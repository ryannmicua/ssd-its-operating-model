# Work Delivery Framework Specification

## 1. System Overview

This framework defines how internal teams, the PMO, delivery managers, and internal engineers turn a new business request into delivery-ready project documentation. Its purpose is to produce complete, unambiguous, buildable, supportable specifications that are sufficient for internal human teams, external development teams, or AI agents to deliver work without redefining the problem during execution.

The framework exists to make “good” and “complete” explicit while avoiding unnecessary process overhead for its own sake.

### 1.1 Scope of applicability

The framework is optimized for software initiatives.

**In scope**
1. Greenfield software projects
2. Brownfield software projects

**Out of scope**
1. Minor low-risk changes
2. Research spikes
3. Support work
4. Small internal process changes

**Conditionally in scope**
1. Complex operational changes affecting multiple organizations
2. Complex internal process changes affecting the whole organization
3. Non-software initiatives that can use the framework with minimum changes

Conditional use does not make this a general enterprise change framework by default. The default design target remains software project delivery.
### 1.2 Framework form and publication model

This framework is a full **operating model** for work definition and delivery readiness. It is not optional guidance.

**Canonical deliverable**
The canonical source of truth is this document (`work_delivery_framework_specification.md`). Teams MUST treat it as the authoritative operating model definition.

**Workflow and control model**
The framework MUST define:
1. how a business request enters the system
2. the sequence of stages a project moves through
3. the outputs required at each stage
4. what “good” and “complete” mean for each required output
5. when work is blocked due to missing or unclear information

**Machine-consumable structure (Markdown-first)**
This document MUST include machine-consumable definitions embedded as fenced YAML blocks with stable IDs so AI agents can extract and apply the framework consistently.

At minimum, the machine-consumable model MUST represent:
1. stages (with entry and exit criteria)
2. artifacts (with required contents and completeness criteria)
3. gates (with pass/fail criteria and stop/proceed rules)

The YAML blocks MUST use stable identifiers (example shapes only):

```yaml
kind: stage
id: STAGE-INTAKE
name: Intake
entry_criteria: []
exit_criteria: []
required_artifacts: []
gate: GATE-INTAKE-EXIT
```

```yaml
kind: artifact
id: ARTIFACT-BUSINESS-REQUEST
name: Business Request
required_sections: []
completeness_criteria: []
```

```yaml
kind: gate
id: GATE-INTAKE-EXIT
name: Intake Exit Gate
pass_criteria: []
fail_conditions: []
default_decision_owner_role: Delivery Owner
requires_named_decision_owner: true
decision_rights: []
```

**Behavioral implication**
The framework MUST support human teams using AI agents as assistants while keeping the final outputs reviewable and enforceable by humans.

## 2. Behavioral Contract

### 2.1 Primary flows

1. When a new business request is introduced, the system defines a clear entry point for teams to evaluate the request and begin documentation.
2. When a team uses the framework for a project, the system guides them through a defined process for producing the required project artifacts.
3. When the project requires delivery documentation, the system defines what artifacts must exist and what each artifact must make observable from the outside.
4. When the project requires solution definition, the system requires documentation of the proposed solution in enough detail for a delivery team to understand what is being built.
5. When the project requires delivery planning, the system requires documentation of how the work will be delivered, not just what the solution is.
6. When the project requires operational readiness, the system requires documentation of how the delivered solution will be supported and maintained over time.
7. When an external development team will implement the work, the system requires a handoff package that is usable by that external team without relying on undocumented assumptions.
8. When internal teams or AI agents will implement the work, the system requires documentation detailed enough for them to produce build specifications, plans, and the required solution without redefining the underlying business need.
9. When teams complete the framework correctly, the system produces a delivery-ready documentation set that includes sufficient context, rules, acceptance criteria, and observable expectations to enable autonomous downstream execution.
10. When a team evaluates whether documentation is complete, the system defines completeness in terms of whether engineering teams can derive technical specifications and produce the required solution without having to reinterpret or reinvent business requirements.

### 2.2 Error flows

1. When required business inputs are missing, the system identifies the missing information as a blocker and records it explicitly.
2. When required dependencies are unavailable or unclear, the system requires those gaps to be documented and raised to stakeholders.
3. When “good” or “complete” cannot be defined because dependencies or requirements are unclear, the system prevents the work from proceeding.
4. When a team attempts to move forward with unresolved ambiguity, the system treats that state as incomplete rather than allowing silent assumption-making.
5. When project documentation appears complete but does not contain enough detail for autonomous delivery, the system treats that output as insufficient.
6. When teams use the framework inconsistently, the system makes inconsistency visible by defining a standard set of required outputs and evaluation criteria.
7. When a project contains risk that is not adequately specified, the system requires that risk to be surfaced in the documentation rather than left implicit.

### 2.3 Boundary conditions

1. When work is simple, the system must still require enough documentation to make the work buildable, but it must not force documentation that does not contribute to delivery readiness.
2. When work is complex, cross-functional, or multi-team, the system must scale to produce a more complete documentation set without lowering the standard of clarity.
3. When work is intended for long-term support and maintenance, the system must require documentation that addresses supportability and maintainability, not only initial delivery.
4. When multiple teams read the same documentation, the system must make the intended outcome clear enough that different teams do not reasonably arrive at conflicting interpretations.
5. When AI agents are used as delivery teams, the system must provide enough precision that the agents do not need to infer missing business requirements.
6. When a project cannot be described with testable acceptance patterns or equivalent observable outcome definitions, the system must treat that as an unresolved gap.
7. When a project would require undocumented assumptions to proceed, the system must stop progression until those assumptions are replaced with explicit decisions or documented open issues.

### 2.4 Lifecycle stages, progression gates, and exit criteria (resolved)

The framework lifecycle is defined as a sequence of formal stages with explicit progression gates. A project MAY be blocked at any gate if the required evidence is missing or ambiguity remains unresolved.

**Important boundary note**
Stages and gates define the control model. The canonical artifact taxonomy is now defined (see Section 2.5). However, scaling thresholds for “small vs large work” are still unresolved (see Ambiguity A09), so the framework defines both packaging modes without yet defining the full tiering/threshold model.

**Stages (in order)**
1. Intake
2. Assessment / Qualification
3. Discovery / Initiative Definition
4. Authorization (conditional)
5. Solution Definition
6. Planning / Project Team Mobilization / MVP Plan
7. Delivery / Execution
8. Handoff / Transition
9. Closure

**Gates (in order)**
1. Qualified Request
2. Initiative Defined (for Authorization decision)
3. Authorized (conditional)
4. Specification Complete
5. MVP Identified (MVP scope + MVP success/acceptance criteria approved)
6. All Deliverables Accepted (Acceptance Owner accepts delivered solution against specified acceptance criteria)
7. Transition Complete (supported operating state accepted)
8. Closure Complete

**Stage → gate mapping**
1. Intake has no progression gate; it establishes initial ownership and opens the record.
2. Assessment / Qualification ends at Gate 1 (Qualified Request).
3. Discovery / Initiative Definition ends at Gate 2 (Initiative Defined).
4. Authorization (conditional) ends at Gate 3 (Authorized).
   - If Authorization is not required, the project transitions from Discovery directly to Solution Definition after Gate 2.
   - Authorization applicability thresholds are defined elsewhere (see Ambiguity A09); until then, Authorization is explicitly conditional and must be declared as “Required” or “Not Required” by the Gate Decision Owner at Gate 2.
5. Solution Definition ends at Gate 4 (Specification Complete).
6. Planning / Mobilization / MVP Plan ends at Gate 5 (MVP Identified).
7. Delivery / Execution ends at Gate 6 (All Deliverables Accepted).
8. Handoff / Transition ends at Gate 7 (Transition Complete).
9. Closure ends at Gate 8 (Closure Complete).

**Minimum evidence categories by gate (high-level)**
1. Gate 1 (Qualified Request): in-scope determination; threshold determination (if applicable); accountable Delivery Owner assigned; initial stakeholder list; known unknowns captured.
2. Gate 2 (Initiative Defined): bounded scope; desired outcomes and success measures; major constraints and dependencies; initial solution direction; estimated effort/shape at an appropriate level; decision on whether Authorization is required.
3. Gate 3 (Authorized): explicit business authorization to invest resources; budget/resource commitment (as applicable); funding/priority decision recorded; Gate Decision Owner named.
4. Gate 4 (Specification Complete): solution definition is complete enough for downstream planning and task breakdown without inventing business requirements; acceptance criteria are defined; critical risks/unknowns are either resolved or explicitly managed as open issues.
5. Gate 5 (MVP Identified): MVP scope is defined; MVP success measures and MVP acceptance criteria are explicit and approved; delivery approach is feasible with the current team and constraints.
6. Gate 6 (All Deliverables Accepted): delivered solution is accepted by the named Acceptance Owner against the specified acceptance criteria; any deviations are explicitly approved and recorded.
7. Gate 7 (Transition Complete): operating ownership is established; support model is ready; transition activities are complete; the solution is in a supported operating state.
8. Gate 8 (Closure Complete): closure requirements are satisfied (final acceptance evidence present, transition complete, decision log updated, outcomes recorded, and closure rationale documented).

### 2.5 Required artifact taxonomy (resolved)

This section defines the canonical artifact taxonomy for this framework (Ambiguity A06).

#### 2.5.1 Category labels vs artifacts

Some labels in this framework are **category labels** rather than artifacts. Category labels are used to organize thinking and required content, but do not imply a mandatory standalone file.

The following are category labels (not artifacts):
1. Project Governance
2. Solution Design
3. DevOps & Support
4. User Adoption

#### 2.5.2 Packaging model: small-work packet vs large-work artifact set

The framework supports two packaging modes:
1. **Small work:** one packet artifact called **Work Brief**.
2. **Large work:** separate canonical artifacts (files) as defined in this section.

**Important note (scaling unresolved):**
The thresholds for “small vs large work” and formal tiering are not yet defined (see Ambiguity A09). Until A09 is resolved, the Delivery Owner MUST explicitly declare whether the project will use **Work Brief** (packet mode) or the **separate artifact set** (large-work mode) no later than Gate 2.

Both names MUST exist:
- **Work Brief** is the small-work form.
- **Initiative Definition / Project Brief** is the large-work form.

#### 2.5.3 Canonical artifacts (names, triggers, and required-by gates)

**Always required**
1. Initiative Definition / Project Brief (large-work mode) **OR** Work Brief (small-work mode) — required by **Gate 2**
2. Decision Log — must exist for every initiative and must exist no later than **Gate 2**

**Conditional artifacts (trigger → artifact(s) → required-by gate)**
1. External vendor involved → Delivery Charter → **Gate 4** (or **Gate 3** when early delivery-team commitment is required)
2. Authorization required → Approved Project Charter → **Gate 3**
3. Material ops/support impact → Technical Design Document (TDD) + Deployment Guide → TDD by **Gate 4**, Deployment Guide by **Gate 6**
4. Data migration → Data Asset Specification + Data Migration Plan → **Gate 4**
5. Security/compliance impact → Access Model + Security/Privacy Risk Impact Assessment → **Gate 4**
6. New integration / API change → API/Contract Specification → **Gate 4**
7. Customer-facing change → User Adoption Plan → start between **Gate 4** and **Gate 6** (earlier is better); must be complete no later than **Gate 6**

**Optional artifact (Delivery Owner discretion)**
1. RAID Register (Risks/Assumptions/Issues/Dependencies) — optional; if used, it SHOULD be created early enough to affect gate decisions and is RECOMMENDED no later than Gate 2.

**Filename guidance**
Artifact names are canonical. Exact filenames are not enforced, but projects are strongly encouraged to use the canonical artifact names as filenames to support consistent discovery and audit.

**Framework evolution note**
The artifact set is expected to evolve as the framework is made clearer. Changes MUST be applied by updating this specification’s artifact definitions (including the machine-consumable YAML blocks) rather than introducing parallel shadow taxonomies.

## 3. Explicit Non-Behaviors

1. The system must not add bureaucracy for its own sake because extra process that does not improve delivery quality weakens adoption and slows execution.
2. The system must not require unnecessary work that is unrelated to delivering the project because the purpose of the framework is delivery readiness, not procedural compliance.
3. The system must not produce code because its role is to define work and delivery expectations, not to implement the solution.
4. The system must not allow work to proceed on incomplete or unclear inputs because downstream teams would be forced to guess or redefine requirements.
5. The system must not treat document presence as proof of completeness because a filled template can still hide critical gaps.
6. The system must not allow teams to substitute local interpretation for explicit specification because the framework is intended to reduce inconsistent delivery behavior.
7. The system must not assume that technically correct delivery is sufficient if supportability, maintainability, or operational readiness are undefined because the outcome would be incomplete in practice.
8. The system must not optimize only for human readers if AI agents are expected consumers because ambiguity tolerated by people can cause agent failure or hallucinated requirements.

## 4. Integration Boundaries

### 4.1 External systems currently in scope

No external software systems, APIs, databases, auth systems, or third-party services are currently defined as part of this framework.

### 4.2 Current operating boundary

The framework currently operates as a standalone knowledge and delivery-definition system. Its primary inputs and outputs are human-authored project information and framework-defined delivery artifacts rather than machine-to-machine integrations.

### 4.3 Data flowing in

1. New business requests
2. Project context
3. Business rules
4. Requirements
5. Constraints
6. Dependencies
7. Acceptance criteria
8. Delivery expectations
9. Support and maintenance expectations
10. Vendor engagement context where applicable

**Minimum request entry payload (Intake entry readiness)**
A request may enter Intake even if it is not yet confirmed in-scope. The purpose of Intake entry is to create a tracked item with an accountable triage owner and to schedule an initial clarification session.

**Required at entry**
1. Requester name
2. Short description that includes:
   - Background / problem / opportunity
   - Desired outcome
   - Success measures (allowed to be explicitly "Unknown/TBD" at entry)
   - Affected systems / processes (allowed to be explicitly "Unknown/TBD" at entry)

**Required operational actions at entry**
1. Assign a triage owner immediately (provisional ownership is allowed).
2. Perform an initial clarification session as part of the initial assessment.

**Entry rejection conditions**
1. Requester name is missing.
2. Short description is missing background / problem / opportunity, or missing desired outcome.
### 4.4 Data flowing out

1. Project documentation
2. Solution definition artifacts
3. Delivery approach documentation
4. Support and maintenance documentation
5. External team handoff documentation where applicable
6. Documentation sufficient for internal teams or AI agents to derive build specifications and delivery plans

### 4.5 Expected contract

Because no external system contract has been defined, the current contract is behavioral rather than technical:

1. Inputs must be clear enough to define what “good” and “complete” mean for the project.
2. Outputs must be specific enough that downstream delivery teams can proceed without redefining business intent.
3. Blockers, missing dependencies, and unresolved questions must be explicitly documented.
4. Work must not be marked ready when hidden assumptions remain.

### 4.6 When external systems are unavailable or return unexpected data

Not applicable as currently specified. No system integrations have been declared.

### 4.7 Real service vs simulated twin during development

Not applicable as currently specified. No external service dependencies have been declared.

## 5. Behavioral Scenarios

These scenarios are intended for external evaluation of the framework’s outcomes. They should be used by reviewers to assess whether the framework works in practice, not by an implementation agent as internal development guidance.

### 5.1 Happy-path scenario 1: Greenfield project reaches delivery-ready definition

**Setup conditions**
1. A new internal software project request is received.
2. Required stakeholders are available.
3. Business objectives and constraints are known.

**Actions**
1. A delivery manager and internal team enter the framework.
2. They follow the framework from request intake through documentation production.
3. They produce the required solution, delivery, and support artifacts.

**Expected observable outcomes**
1. A reviewer can identify the proposed solution, delivery approach, support expectations, and acceptance criteria from the resulting documentation.
2. An engineering team can explain what needs to be built without redefining the business problem.
3. The documentation contains enough detail for technical specifications and delivery planning to proceed without requesting foundational clarification.

### 5.2 Happy-path scenario 2: External development team receives a usable handoff

**Setup conditions**
1. A project will be delivered by an external development team.
2. Stakeholders have provided the needed business context and objectives.

**Actions**
1. The internal team uses the framework to prepare the project documentation and external handoff pack.
2. The handoff is given to an independent delivery reviewer acting as the external team.

**Expected observable outcomes**
1. The reviewer can state what the external team is expected to build, how success will be judged, and what support expectations exist after delivery.
2. The reviewer does not need undocumented tribal knowledge to understand the assignment.
3. The reviewer can identify what is in scope and what is not in scope from the artifacts alone.

### 5.3 Happy-path scenario 3: AI-assisted delivery can proceed without requirement redefinition

**Setup conditions**
1. A project is intended to be delivered with material AI-agent participation.
2. The business request includes rules and intended outcomes.

**Actions**
1. The framework is used to define the project and produce its documentation.
2. A separate evaluator reviews the documentation from the perspective of an AI-enabled engineering team.

**Expected observable outcomes**
1. The evaluator can derive build specifications or implementation plans from the documentation without inventing missing business rules.
2. Acceptance criteria are expressed in a way that allows observable validation rather than subjective interpretation.
3. The evaluator finds no critical area where the only path forward is to guess what the business intended.

### 5.4 Error scenario 1: Missing dependency blocks progression

**Setup conditions**
1. A business request exists, but a required dependency or decision is unavailable or unclear.

**Actions**
1. The team begins using the framework.
2. During definition, they discover the missing dependency.

**Expected observable outcomes**
1. The missing dependency is explicitly documented.
2. The issue is visible as a blocker requiring stakeholder resolution.
3. The work is not marked ready to proceed.
4. No artifact falsely presents the project as complete.

### 5.5 Error scenario 2: Documentation looks finished but hides critical gaps

**Setup conditions**
1. A team has completed the framework artifacts.
2. The artifacts are formatted well and appear complete on first review.

**Actions**
1. An independent engineering reviewer attempts to derive technical specifications from the documentation.
2. The reviewer checks whether assumptions are required to continue.

**Expected observable outcomes**
1. If critical business logic, constraints, support expectations, or acceptance conditions are missing, the framework evaluation fails the documentation.
2. The output is judged incomplete even though documents exist.
3. The gaps are surfaced explicitly rather than being absorbed into downstream interpretation.

### 5.6 Edge-case scenario 1: Small request with pressure to over-document

**Setup conditions**
1. A relatively small change request is raised.
2. Team members are concerned the framework may force unnecessary work.

**Actions**
1. The team applies the framework to the request.
2. A reviewer compares the produced outputs with the actual delivery need.

**Expected observable outcomes**
1. The documentation is sufficient to make the work buildable and supportable.
2. The framework does not require obviously irrelevant or non-value-adding outputs merely to satisfy process formality.
3. Reviewers conclude that the framework supported delivery readiness without adding avoidable bureaucracy.

### 5.7 Edge-case scenario 2: Large multi-team initiative with long-term support needs

**Setup conditions**
1. A complex enterprise initiative spans multiple internal teams and has long-term operational impact.

**Actions**
1. The framework is applied across the initiative.
2. Multiple teams review the resulting documentation independently.

**Expected observable outcomes**
1. Teams can align on the intended solution and delivery shape from the same documentation set.
2. Supportability and maintainability expectations are visible, not implied.
3. Reviewers judge the artifacts sufficient for coordinated downstream planning across teams without conflicting interpretations of core requirements.

## 6. Ambiguity Warnings

### 6.1 Framework format is resolved

**Resolved decision**
This framework is a full operating model for work definition and delivery readiness, expressed as a Markdown-first canonical specification with enforceable workflow stages, stage gates, and artifact definitions.

**Publication model**
The canonical source of truth is this specification file. It MUST embed machine-consumable YAML blocks (with stable IDs) for stages, artifacts, and gates so AI agents can apply it consistently.

**Implication for implementation**
Subsequent framework refinements MUST extend the structured YAML model in this document rather than creating parallel “shadow” definitions elsewhere.
### 6.2 Required artifact set is resolved

**Resolved decision**
The canonical artifact taxonomy is now defined in Section 2.5, including:
1. The small-work packet model (Work Brief)
2. The large-work separate-artifact model
3. The always-required artifacts (including a Decision Log)
4. The conditional artifacts and their triggers
5. Gate timing expectations for when each artifact must exist

**Implication for implementation**
Implementations and downstream templates MUST align to the canonical artifact names and the machine-consumable artifact YAML blocks in Section 2.5, rather than inventing alternative local artifact taxonomies.

### 6.3 Entry and exit criteria are not explicit

**What is ambiguous**
The framework’s starting trigger is broadly “a new business request,” but the exact readiness gates for entering, progressing, and completing the framework are not fully defined.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely invent stage gates such as intake, discovery, definition, handoff, and approval.

**Question to resolve**
What are the formal stages, and what evidence is required to move from one stage to the next?

### 6.4 Scope differentiation by work type is resolved

**Resolved decision**
The framework is optimized for software initiatives. It is in scope for greenfield and brownfield software projects. It is out of scope for minor low-risk changes, research spikes, support work, and small internal process changes. It may be used conditionally for complex operational changes affecting multiple organizations, complex internal process changes affecting the whole organization, and non-software initiatives that can use the framework with minimum changes.

**Implication for implementation**
The default framework shape should be designed for software project delivery first. Conditional reuse is allowed where the same control logic fits, but this decision does not broaden the framework into a universal model for all organizational work.

### 6.5 “Good” and “complete” are directionally defined but not operationalized

**What is ambiguous**
You defined the intent of completeness, but not the explicit checklist or rubric by which reviewers decide that a document set is complete.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely create its own quality rubric.

**Question to resolve**
What observable criteria must be satisfied for documentation to be judged complete and delivery-ready?

### 6.6 Treatment of simple vs complex work is undefined

**What is ambiguous**
You want to avoid bureaucracy, but there is no rule for how the framework scales up or down based on project size, risk, or complexity.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely create tiers or classifications without your approval.

**Question to resolve**
Should the framework have lightweight, standard, and complex paths, and if so, what determines which path applies?

### 6.7 Governance and ownership are resolved

**Resolved decision**
1. The framework owner is the PMO. The PMO is accountable for maintaining, evolving, and publishing this framework.
2. Every gate in the framework MUST have a single accountable Gate Decision Owner (a named person) for the stop/proceed decision.
3. The Gate Decision Owner for each gate is assigned at Intake by the PMO or the project Delivery Owner and recorded in the Initiative Definition / Project Brief. For large projects with a formal project charter, this information MUST also be recorded in the Project Charter.
4. There are no role-based veto rights in this framework. The Gate Decision Owner is accountable for decisions made.
5. If there is substantive disagreement at a gate, the Gate Decision Owner MUST identify an alternative path forward (scope, sequencing, approach, or risk treatment) and record a plan of action forward in the project Decision Log.

**Default Gate Decision Owner roles (unless explicitly overridden by name in the Initiative Definition / Project Brief)**
1. Qualified Request: Delivery Owner
2. Initiative Defined (for Authorization decision): Delivery Owner
3. Authorized (when Authorization is required): Business / Product Owner (Budget Owner)
4. Specification Complete: Delivery Owner
5. MVP Identified: Delivery Owner
6. All Deliverables Accepted: Acceptance Owner (Business / Product Owner)
7. Transition Complete: Operations / Support Owner
8. Closure Complete: PMO / ITS Director
9. External handoff readiness (if an external team will build): Delivery Owner

**Consent model (for being named as Gate Decision Owner)**
Consent is implied when there is no objection upon acceptance of the document where the person is listed. It is expected that the named Gate Decision Owner will be informed of their responsibilities.

**Implication for implementation**
Gate definitions in the machine-consumable YAML model MUST specify a default_decision_owner_role and MUST require a named decision owner per project (recorded in the Initiative Definition / Project Brief).

### 6.8 Relationship to technical specification work is unclear

**What is ambiguous**
The framework is supposed to produce documentation that allows technical specifications to be created, but it is unclear whether technical specs are part of the framework output or a downstream activity.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely include technical specification templates inside the framework.

**Question to resolve**
Does the framework end at delivery-ready business and solution definition, or must it also define the structure of technical specifications?

### 6.9 Acceptance and holdout pattern expectations are underdefined

**What is ambiguous**
You mentioned acceptance criteria and holdout patterns as examples of the context engineering teams need, but their required form and level of rigor are not specified.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely introduce its own testing or acceptance-writing model.

**Question to resolve**
What form should acceptance criteria take, and what do you mean by “testable using holdout patterns” in this framework?

### 6.10 External team engagement modes are underspecified

**What is ambiguous**
You mentioned external development teams, but not whether this includes full outsourced delivery, co-delivery, staff augmentation, or advisory vendors.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely design for one generic vendor handoff model.

**Question to resolve**
What external engagement models must the framework support, and how should handoff requirements differ across them?

### 6.11 Supportability and maintainability expectations are not yet decomposed

**What is ambiguous**
You require long-term supportability and maintainability, but the exact observable requirements are not stated.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely invent generic operational-readiness sections.

**Question to resolve**
What minimum support and maintenance information must always be defined before work is considered ready?

### 6.12 Review and audit method is unclear

**What is ambiguous**
It is not defined how humans will evaluate whether the framework output is sufficient in practice.

**Likely agent assumption**
An agent would likely add an internal checklist or approval review without knowing your preferred review mechanism.

**Question to resolve**
How should framework outputs be reviewed: peer review, PMO checkpoint, architecture review, delivery readiness review, or another mechanism?

## 7. Implementation Constraints

1. The implementation must remain minimal and avoid adding process overhead that does not improve delivery readiness.
2. The implementation must be suitable for human teams and AI-agent consumers.
3. The implementation must support complex enterprise and large multi-team initiatives.
4. No software integrations are currently required.
5. No code generation or solution implementation is in scope.

## 8. Remaining Contradictions

No direct contradictions were stated, but there is one tension that should be resolved explicitly: the framework must be rigorous enough for autonomous delivery while also avoiding bureaucracy. That tension is manageable, but only if you define how rigor scales by project type, risk, and complexity.
