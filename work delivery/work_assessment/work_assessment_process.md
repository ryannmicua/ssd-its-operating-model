## Quick Start

Use this guide when a request, problem, risk, or opportunity needs to be screened before Work Definition begins.

This process gives practitioners a practical way to stop weak work early, deepen scrutiny only where justified, and pass forward only the work that is worth defining.

Follow this core flow, using the supporting artifacts inside the relevant step:

1. Complete the [Initial Review](initial_review_specification.md) as a quick IT-side sanity check on whether the request is worth more time and broadly aligns with what the organization does.
2. Prepare the [Challenges and Needs](challenges_and_needs_specification.md) artifact to sharpen the problem basis before deeper validation starts.
3. Complete the [Validation Assessment](validation_assessment_specification.md) with the requester's subject matter experts and immediate team to decide whether focused analysis is justified and what minimum questions it must answer.
4. Use the [Current State Analysis Report](current_state_analysis_report_specification.md) and the [Business Process Stage Analysis](business_process_stage_analysis_specification.md) only where the current state, workflow stages, handoffs, controls, or operational realities need to be captured more explicitly.
5. Complete the [Work Assessment Report](work_assessment_report_specification.md) as the culmination of that right-sized analysis to decide whether the initiative should enter Work Definition.

Use the supporting artifacts only where they make the assessment clearer and more reusable without turning Work Assessment into Work Definition. The exception is the [Challenges and Needs Specification](challenges_and_needs_specification.md), which this branch treats as a normal supporting artifact for work that reaches Validation Assessment.

The normal handoff is:

`Work Assessment Report -> Initiative Definition Document`

The report is the final work assessment decision basis. The Initiative Definition Document then becomes the normal definition baseline when work proceeds.

For appropriately small governed work, the next definition artifact may be a [Work Brief](../work_brief/work_brief_specification.md) instead of a full Initiative Definition Document.

What this process is for:

- stopping weak or unsupported work early
- identifying whether deeper definition effort is justified
- making sponsorship, risk, and timing concerns visible before commitment
- giving definition a clean, practical starting point
- establishing a reliable assessment reference base so definition does not need to rediscover basic need, current-state, stakeholder, and requirement context
- making business challenges, unmet needs, and current-state realities explicit enough that later definition can reuse them rather than restating them from scratch

What this process is not for:

- delivery authorization
- detailed solution design
- detailed requirements or implementation planning
- vendor selection or build-ready specification work

## 1. Purpose

This document is the practical operating guide for Work Assessment.

It shows teams how to assess proposed work through three increasing levels of scrutiny so that:

- low-value or weakly supported requests can stop quickly
- promising work can be tested before deeper effort is invested
- the final output is decision-ready and usable as input to Work Definition
- only the minimum analysis needed to support a sound work assessment decision and definition handoff is performed

## 2. Where This Process Fits

This process can be used on its own as the front-end assessment path for planned work. Where the broader [Work Delivery Framework](../work_delivery_framework.md) is used, it aligns to Work Assessment and feeds Work Definition. It does not replace later decision or authorization controls.

Use it before:

- drafting the Initiative Definition Document
- seeking Work Authorization
- producing detailed solution or operational design artifacts

The normal progression is:

`Initial Review -> Validation Assessment -> Work Assessment Report -> Initiative Definition Document`

Supporting assessment artifacts can be used around that core flow without replacing it:

- [Challenges and Needs](challenges_and_needs_specification.md) is a required supporting artifact when work enters Validation Assessment.
- [Current State Analysis Report](current_state_analysis_report_specification.md) is situational and is used when current-state evidence needs to be more explicit than the gate artifacts can hold cleanly.
- [Business Process Stage Analysis](business_process_stage_analysis_specification.md) is situational and is used when stage-by-stage process flow, handoffs, actors, data, or control points materially shape the assessment.

This process decides whether the work is worth defining. Work Definition then defines what should actually be authorized.

Proceeding from Work Assessment is not delivery authorization.

## 3. Who Does What

| Role | What to focus on in this guide |
| --- | --- |
| Requestor / Submitter | Provide the need, trigger, and context for why the request exists |
| IT Assessment Owner | Drive the stage, keep it time-boxed, and produce a usable recommendation |
| Sponsor / Sponsor Candidate | Confirm the work matters and is worth advocating for if it proceeds |
| Outcome Owner Candidate | Clarify what meaningful improvement is being sought |
| ITS Leadership / Intake Governance | Decide whether to stop, defer, or let the work advance |
| Requester SMEs and Immediate Team | Contribute business context, boundaries, outcomes, and practical constraints during Validation |
| Analysis Lead / Business Analysis Lead | Produce the right-sized analysis and any situational current-state or process-stage artifacts that culminate in the Work Assessment Report |
| Subject Matter Leads | Contribute targeted evidence where risk, support, security, data, operations, or compliance matter |

## 4. Before You Start

Before drafting a work assessment artifact, make sure you have at least:

- a short description of the request or opportunity
- the current step inside Work Assessment
- the named Assessment Owner
- the expected decision-maker for the next gate
- enough source context to avoid pure guesswork

If these are missing, you can still create a working draft, but label it clearly as incomplete and do not treat it as ready for a decision.

## 5. Step Summary

| Step | Minimum inputs | Required outputs | Completion check | Accountable owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Initial Review | request summary, source, problem signal, basic stakeholder context, optional problem-framing notes where needed | Initial Review, initial decision record, optional early-draft Challenges and Needs notes (for Step 2) | the need is understandable, obvious dealbreakers are checked, and the recommendation is explicit | IT Assessment Owner |
| 2. Validation Assessment | approved Initial Review, requester SME input, and basic current-state facts | Validation Assessment, Challenges and Needs, recommendation on whether to do focused analysis | the need is validated, the problem basis is clearer, sponsorship is tested, outcomes and scope boundaries are clearer, and the case for focused analysis is explicit | IT Assessment Owner with requester SMEs and sponsor candidate |
| 3. Work Assessment Report | approved Validation Assessment, completed focused analysis, validated scope and outcome context, stakeholder position, risk and feasibility view, preferred path, and any situational supporting analysis | Work Assessment Report, final work assessment decision record, reference notes to the supporting assessment artifacts, recommended next definition artifact (Initiative Definition Document or Work Brief) | decision-makers can see whether Work Definition is justified, under what conditions, what current-state facts shape it, and what must be clarified next | Analysis lead with sponsor and ITS leadership |

## 6. Guided Workflow

### 6.1. Step 1 - Initial Review

Goal:
Decide quickly whether the request is worth any further assessment effort from the IT side.

Use this spec:

- [Initial Review Specification](initial_review_specification.md)

Do this:

1. Capture the problem, risk, or opportunity in plain language.
2. Record the desired improvement without describing a solution.
3. Note who is affected, why it matters, and what happens if nothing changes.
4. Check for obvious dealbreakers such as no mandate, no value, clear misalignment, or impossible constraints.
5. Record one of three recommendations: stop, defer, or proceed to Validation Assessment.

Produce:

- Initial Review
- decision record

Do not:

- design the solution
- estimate effort in detail
- keep exploring once a clear stop signal already exists

### 6.2. Step 2 - Validation Assessment

Goal:
Validate that the opportunity is strong enough to justify focused analysis and not obviously blocked by sponsorship, strategy, business alignment, risk, supportability, capability, or funding concerns.

Use this spec:

- [Challenges and Needs Specification](challenges_and_needs_specification.md)
- [Validation Assessment Specification](validation_assessment_specification.md)

Do this:

1. Capture the work request challenges, unmet needs, affected parties, impacts, and consequence of inaction in a short structured way before the deeper validation narrative is finalized.
2. Refine the problem statement using input from the requester's subject matter experts and immediate team.
3. Confirm organizational alignment, primary beneficiary, desired outcomes, success measures, current-state constraints, key stakeholder needs, and scope boundaries.
4. Describe high-level requirements or capabilities and compare credible conceptual options, including doing nothing.
5. Surface major risk and feasibility signals across sponsorship, strategy, security, operations, delivery capability, and funding.
6. Decide whether focused analysis is justified and record what that analysis must answer if the work proceeds.

Produce:

- Challenges and Needs
- Validation Assessment
- recommendation to stop, defer, or proceed to focused analysis

Do not:

- turn capabilities into detailed requirements
- turn challenge statements into solution proposals
- write vendor comparisons
- begin delivery planning

Supporting artifact status in this step:

- [Challenges and Needs](challenges_and_needs_specification.md): required
- [Current State Analysis Report](current_state_analysis_report_specification.md): situational, start here if the current state is too complex or disputed for a short Validation Assessment summary
- [Business Process Stage Analysis](business_process_stage_analysis_specification.md): situational, use where stage-by-stage business flow, handoffs, actors, inputs, or controls materially shape the work request

### 6.3. Step 3 - Work Assessment Report

Goal:
Produce the final work assessment and recommendation on whether the work should enter Work Definition, using the completed focused analysis as the decision basis.

Use this spec:

- [Current State Analysis Report Specification](current_state_analysis_report_specification.md) where needed
- [Business Process Stage Analysis Specification](business_process_stage_analysis_specification.md) where needed
- [Work Assessment Report Specification](work_assessment_report_specification.md)

Do this:

1. Complete any situational current-state or process-stage analysis needed to make the recommendation credible and reusable.
2. Synthesize the analysis findings, validated need, current state, stakeholder needs, high-level requirements, options, risks, timing, and likely value.
3. State the preferred direction clearly, including why that path is better than the alternatives.
4. Show that there is enough information to make an informed decision to define the initiative and move it toward authorization.
5. Describe the recommended definition starting boundary without trying to define the full initiative yet.
6. Record what the next definition step must confirm, define, or resolve if work proceeds.
7. Record the final work assessment decision and handoff basis.

Produce:

- Work Assessment Report
- final work assessment decision record
- clear references to any supporting assessment artifacts used

Do not:

- treat the report as an Initiative Definition Document
- treat a recommendation to proceed as delivery approval
- bury unresolved issues in narrative text
- create supporting analysis that is more detailed than the assessment decision and handoff need justify

## 7. Practical Timebox Guidance

Keep the stage practical.

Typical working expectations:

- Initial Review: days, not weeks
- Validation Assessment: usually 1 to 2 weeks
- Focused analysis and Work Assessment Report: only as much effort as needed to support an informed work assessment decision and a usable definition starting point

## 8. Optional Assessment Work Brief

The existing "opportunity assessment work brief" pattern is still useful when the assessment effort itself needs explicit time-boxing, ownership, or capacity approval.

Use a short internal work brief only when needed to clarify:

- who is doing the assessment
- what questions must be answered
- what is in and out of scope for the assessment effort
- what decision is being requested at the end of the assessment

This is optional support material. It is not one of the three core gating artifacts in this process.

## 9. Handoff to Work Definition

If the final assessment decision is to proceed, Work Definition should start from the Work Assessment Report and the referenced assessment artifacts, and should not re-discover the same basics.

At minimum, definition should be able to reference:

- validated statement of need
- confirmed business challenges and unmet needs that still shape the work
- desired outcomes
- success measures
- sponsor and owner candidates
- preferred title or working label for the item being defined
- the recommended path or preferred option
- why that path is the recommended basis for definition
- major constraints, dependencies, and unresolved questions
- the recommended next definition artifact and why
- any ownership or authority gaps that definition must close early
- the specific issues definition must clarify before authorization

Work Assessment should not try to complete the full definition artifact. It should, however, leave behind a usable assessment reference base and a small definition-ready baseline so definition starts from accepted assessment conclusions rather than rediscovering them.

For work that proceeds, the assessment set should be explicit enough that definition can immediately reference:

- the approved problem statement and intended outcome
- the practical challenge and unmet-need basis already established during assessment
- a concise current-state summary covering the systems, workflows, constraints, or prior attempts that materially shape definition
- the success measures to preserve
- the key stakeholder groups and their material needs or requirements
- the high-level requirements or capabilities any viable solution must address
- the proposed in-scope and out-of-scope boundary
- the preferred option to define, including the reason for that direction
- named sponsor, Outcome Owner, Delivery Owner, and Decision Authority signals, or a clear statement of which roles are still unresolved
- the likely deliverable domains that definition will need to make visible, and which of those domains appear material enough to require authorization-level coverage
- the assumptions definition must either preserve, validate, or resolve explicitly
- operational, support, security, privacy, compliance, funding, or dependency concerns that materially shape definition work

### 9.1. Standard assessment reference set

Use the following core assessment outputs when a work item moves from Work Assessment into Initiative Definition or a Work Brief.

| Core work assessment reference output | Minimum content | Primary use in definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem / Opportunity Statement | validated need, why it matters now, consequence of inaction | becomes the basis for the Initiative Definition business need and executive summary |
| Challenges and Needs Summary | affected parties, visible pain points, underlying unmet needs, and why action matters now | helps definition preserve the problem basis and avoid slipping back into solution-first framing |
| Current State Summary | relevant systems, workflows, pain points, constraints, dependencies, or prior attempts | gives definition the current-state context needed for scope, risk, and support discussions |
| Stakeholders | sponsor and owner signals, affected stakeholder groups, and their material needs | helps definition confirm ownership, acceptance involvement, and change impact early |
| High-Level Requirements | what any viable answer must achieve, without design detail | gives definition a concise baseline before detailed elaboration starts |
| Risks / Constraints | material delivery, security, support, funding, compliance, or timing concerns | informs the Initiative Definition risk, dependency, and major-impact view |
| Assumptions | working assumptions that shape the recommendation and still need confirmation | shows definition what must be validated rather than silently carried forward |

Keep these outputs concise. They are not seven separate large documents. In normal use they should be captured in the existing assessment artifacts, with the Work Assessment Report pointing to them where extra clarity is materially useful.

### 9.2. Deliverable selection guide

Scale the handoff depth to the work, not to a fixed template burden.

| Work profile | Typical signals | Reference expectation | Normal next definition path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small / low risk | one team or a narrow change, limited integration, low support or compliance impact, ownership is straightforward | keep the seven core outputs brief and easy to reference from the existing assessment artifacts | usually a Work Brief |
| Medium | cross-team coordination, moderate dependency or service impact, some unresolved ownership or acceptance detail | make the standard seven-output set explicit across the assessment artifacts, with a clear preferred path and explicit open questions for definition | Initiative Definition Document or Work Brief if the work still behaves like one clear governed item |
| Large / complex | multiple teams, significant data, security, operational, funding, or regulatory impact, or materially uncertain ownership or scope | deepen only the parts of the standard seven-output set that materially change the decision, definition boundary, or required deliverable domains | Initiative Definition Document |

If additional analysis does not change the recommendation, the definition boundary, the ownership model, or the likely deliverable domains, do not add it just for completeness.

The next definition step then produces the Initiative Definition Document and supporting authorization-level artifacts, or uses a Work Brief where the work is intentionally scaled and still governed.

## 10. AI-Assisted Authoring Workflow

When AI is helping with work assessment artifacts, use this simple loop:

1. Human states the assessment step, objective, source inputs, and decision needed.
2. AI drafts only within that step boundary.
3. Human reviews for clarity, sponsorship, risk visibility, and practical usefulness.
4. AI revises using explicit feedback.
5. Human confirms the recommendation and decision record.

AI can help:

- summarize intake notes
- structure the problem statement
- draft options, comparisons, and recommendation wording
- identify obvious gaps or contradictions in the assessment package

AI must not:

- make the go / no-go decision
- claim sponsorship, funding, or authority that has not been confirmed
- treat assumptions as approvals
- invent evidence or stakeholder support

## 11. Governance Health Signals

Good signs:

- work stops early when value or sponsorship is weak
- the level of effort increases only when the previous step justifies it
- the Work Assessment Report gives definition a clean starting point
- the recommendation is explicit and attributable

Warning signs:

- every request jumps straight into definition
- initial screening includes design, requirements, or vendor detail
- kill risks are visible but ignored
- definition is forced to rediscover basic problem, stakeholder, and risk context
- "proceed" is treated as approval to deliver
