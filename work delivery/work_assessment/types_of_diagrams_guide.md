# Types of Diagrams Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide helps practitioners and AI agents choose the lightest useful diagram when Work Assessment needs a visual view of the current process, current state, handoffs, data movement, or assessment boundary.

The intent is not to produce diagrams for their own sake. The intent is to choose a diagram only when it makes the current state easier to understand, review, or carry forward.

## 2. How to Use This Guide

Choose the simplest diagram that answers the assessment question clearly.

Use a diagram when it materially improves understanding of:

- process stages
- handoffs between roles or teams
- current-state boundaries
- inputs, outputs, and customers
- data movement between people, systems, and records

Do not use a heavy notation if a short table or simple flowchart is enough.

## 3. The 5 Most Helpful Diagram Types in This Context

### 3.1. SIPOC diagram

Best use:

- early assessment when you need a quick high-level process boundary
- clarifying suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, and customers before deeper analysis

Most helpful when:

- the process is still poorly framed
- the team needs a shared starting view before building a flowchart

Less helpful when:

- you need to show detailed handoffs, decisions, or exceptions

Why it fits our context:

- good for Work Request Challenges and Needs and early Validation Assessment
- keeps assessment light while making the process boundary explicit

### 3.2. Basic flowchart

Best use:

- a mostly linear process with a manageable number of decisions
- quickly showing the normal current path from start to finish

Most helpful when:

- one team or one owner mainly performs the work
- the main need is to show sequence rather than ownership complexity

Less helpful when:

- multiple teams, handoffs, or message exchanges matter

Why it fits our context:

- good for a light Business Process Stage Analysis where the stage sequence is more important than cross-team structure

### 3.3. Cross-functional flowchart

Best use:

- showing who does what and where handoffs occur
- making lane ownership and phase progression visible

Most helpful when:

- the main issue sits between teams, roles, offices, or departments
- work moves across functional boundaries and delays or rework happen at handoff points

Less helpful when:

- the process is highly event-driven or message-heavy and needs a more formal notation

Why it fits our context:

- often the most practical choice for Work Assessment because it makes accountability and handoffs visible without requiring a heavy standard

### 3.4. BPMN diagram

Best use:

- processes with multiple participants, gateways, events, exceptions, messages, or control points
- cases where a common formal notation helps avoid ambiguity

Most helpful when:

- the workflow is complex enough that a basic or swimlane flowchart becomes hard to read
- the assessment must make decision logic, message flows, or collaboration boundaries explicit

Less helpful when:

- the audience only needs a lightweight current-state picture
- the process is simple and the notation would add more complexity than clarity

Why it fits our context:

- useful for higher-complexity Business Process Stage Analysis or Current State Analysis where controls, exceptions, and inter-team interactions materially shape the recommendation

### 3.5. Data flow diagram

Best use:

- showing how information moves between people, systems, processes, and data stores
- clarifying records, interfaces, inputs, outputs, and data dependencies

Most helpful when:

- the work request is shaped by fragmented systems, duplicate data entry, unclear records, or interface gaps
- the team needs to separate work sequence from data movement

Less helpful when:

- the main need is to show task sequence or role accountability

Why it fits our context:

- useful for Current State Analysis when records, data movement, or control evidence matter as much as the activity sequence

## 4. Quick Selection Guide

| If you need to show... | Start with... | Move up to... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| basic process boundary and key inputs and outputs | SIPOC | basic flowchart |
| simple step sequence | basic flowchart | cross-functional flowchart |
| roles, handoffs, and accountability | cross-functional flowchart | BPMN |
| events, gateways, exceptions, or message exchanges | BPMN | BPMN with a short companion table |
| data movement, records, or data stores | data flow diagram | data flow diagram plus a simple process flow |

## 5. Practical Guidance for This Repository

- Use the lightest diagram that answers the assessment question.
- Pair diagrams with short text so the governance meaning is explicit.
- Do not let diagrams replace required narrative or table content in the specifications.
- In Work Assessment, diagram only the current state unless the artifact explicitly asks for something else.
- If the diagram becomes hard to explain quickly, it is probably too detailed for Work Assessment.
