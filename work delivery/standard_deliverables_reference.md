# Standard Deliverables Reference

## Purpose

Provide a practical reference list of common deliverables used in initiatives governed by the Work Delivery Framework.

This document helps teams think through what artifacts may be needed across different areas of an initiative (such as solution design, data, operations, security, governance, and user adoption).

## Deliverable Domains

A deliverable domain is a practical grouping of related deliverables.

Each domain covers one important area of delivery, such as solution design, governance, operations, data, security, or user adoption.

Using domains helps teams answer a simple question early: **"Have we covered all critical areas, not only build work?"**

During Work Definition, the team confirms which domains are in scope. Not every initiative needs every domain.

## How to Use Standard Deliverables

Use this document as a **selection and control guide**, not as a requirement to produce every document listed.

1. Confirm which deliverable domains are in scope for the initiative.
2. For each in-scope domain, select the standard deliverables that fit the initiative size, risk, and complexity.
3. Assign a clear owner and Acceptance Authority for each selected deliverable.
4. Use the domain Acceptance Focus questions to define what "done" means.
5. Collect acceptance evidence as delivery progresses, then record formal acceptance.

If a deliverable is excluded, record why it is excluded. This keeps governance decisions visible and auditable.

## 1. Solution Deliverables

### Purpose

Deliver the approved business outcomes through an implemented solution that remains aligned to authorized scope and is supported by clear documentation governing scope, structure, behavior, roles, and acceptance.

### Standard Deliverables (as applicable)

- **Deployed Solution**
- **Functional Capabilities**
- **Solution Modules**
- **Use Case Narratives**
- **User Roles, Personas & Access Model**
- **Acceptance Record**

### Deployed Solution

The implemented system behavior that delivers the approved business capabilities and outcomes.

The deployed solution must remain within the intent and boundaries of the authorized scope.

### Functional Capabilities

Defines the approved functional scope of the initiative, including:

- The set of approved business capabilities

This document establishes what the solution must be able to do.

### Solution Modules

Organizes the approved capabilities into coherent, testable segments that support controlled delivery and acceptance.

This document clarifies how approved capabilities are grouped for build, testing, deployment, and validation, without redefining scope.

### Use Case Narratives

Describe how users achieve outcomes using the solution.

Use cases define:

- Who is acting
- What triggers the action
- What outcome is expected
- What rules and validations apply
- What must be true for the behavior to be accepted as correct

This is the behavioral validation artifact.

### User Roles, Personas & Access Model

Defines:

- The categories of users interacting with the solution
- Their responsibilities, goals, and behavioral expectations
- Access boundaries and separation-of-duties assumptions
- Any sensitive data interactions that affect governance
- Optional personas that provide practical context for how different users within a role operate in real-world conditions

Personas, where used, add clarity to user behavior, constraints, and adoption considerations without expanding authorized scope. They help ensure use cases, validation, and enablement decisions reflect real user needs.

This artifact ensures user behavior, access expectations, and governance assumptions are explicit, reviewable, and aligned with the approved scope.

### Acceptance Record

Provides consolidated evidence that:

- All approved capabilities are implemented
- No unapproved behavior has been introduced
- Documented behaviors have been validated
- Acceptance decisions are formally recorded

This artifact demonstrates that the delivered solution aligns with what was authorized.

## How to Use This Document

This document serves as the authoritative catalog of standard deliverables and acceptance expectations across deliverable domains.

It does not make every deliverable mandatory for every initiative. During Work Definition, teams determine which deliverable domains are in scope and which standard deliverables are appropriate for the initiative's nature, scale, and risk.

### During Work Definition (Stage 2)

- Confirm which deliverable domains are in scope (each domain is explicitly included or excluded).
- Identify the Acceptance Authority for every in-scope domain.
- Agree which standard deliverables are expected for each in-scope domain (as applicable), at approval-level depth.
- Use the Acceptance Focus questions as the basis for defining what “done” will mean later at acceptance.

### During Work Authorization (Stage 3)

- Confirm that scope, ownership, funding commitments, and risk implications are decision-ready.
- Confirm Acceptance Authorities remain valid for each in-scope domain.
- Record the authorization decision and associated commitments.

### During Work Definition Details (Stage 4)

- Produce the detailed versions of in-scope deliverables needed to build, test, transition, and accept the solution.
- Ensure elaboration remains consistent with the authorized scope and intent.

### During Work Delivery (Stage 6)

- Produce the required deliverables for each in-scope domain and collect acceptance evidence.
- Use the Acceptance Focus questions to drive validation and evidence collection.
- Track progress by accepted deliverables and evidence, not activity.

### During Acceptance, Transition & Closure (Stage 7)

- Validate that Acceptance Focus questions are answered for every in-scope domain.
- Ensure required evidence is complete, reviewable, and attributable.
- Record formal acceptance by the named Acceptance Authorities and formally close the initiative.

Completion requires acceptance across all applicable deliverable domains.
