# Work Delivery Framework

## 1. Purpose

This framework governs planned work delivery initiatives, including projects, significant enhancements, and smaller governed initiatives.

It puts the Define-Decide-Deliver (DDD) Work Management Model into practice by defining the minimum decisions, documents, ownership, and controls needed to deliver work clearly, accountably, and sustainably.

- [Solution Design Process](solution_design_process.md)
- [AI-Assisted Work Delivery Recommendations](ai_assisted_work_delivery_recommendations.md)

## 2. Intended Outcome

When applied consistently:

- work does not start informally
- scope and outcomes are clear before authorization
- ownership and decision rights are explicit
- delivery progress is visible through accepted outputs, not activity alone
- changes are traceable and controlled
- operational support is prepared before handover
- acceptance and closure are formal, attributable, and evidence-based

## 3. Applicability and Scaling

This framework applies to:

- projects
- significant enhancements
- smaller planned initiatives that still require governance, coordination, and formal acceptance

To keep the framework practical:

- use the minimum viable level of detail needed for the work's size, risk, and impact
- one document may satisfy multiple outputs if the required information is explicit and traceable
- smaller initiatives may use concise versions of artifacts, but they must not skip decision points, ownership, or acceptance controls

The framework is intentionally control-light for low-complexity work and should scale up only where risk, cost, impact, or cross-team coordination require it.

## 4. Operating Principles

1. Define before authorizing.
2. Authorize before delivering.
3. Elaborate without expanding authorized scope.
4. Measure progress by accepted deliverables and evidence.
5. Transition to operations with named ownership.
6. Keep artifacts practical, readable, and usable by both humans and AI.

### 5.1. Delegated Decision Authority

For organizational initiatives, a committee may be the ultimate approving body.

It is not necessary for the committee to make every decision directly. A named person may act as the Decision Authority on behalf of the committee when delegation is explicit and recorded.

Where decision authority is delegated, the record should make visible:

- the committee or authority delegating the decision right
- the named delegated person
- the kinds of decisions covered by the delegation
- any limits on scope, cost, risk, policy, or acceptance authority
- when the matter must return to the committee or higher authority

Delegated authority must not be assumed or inferred. If delegation is not explicit, the decision should be treated as reserved to the committee or other formal approving authority.

## 6. Decision Record Minimum

The minimum standard for a decision record in Stages 1, 2, 3, and 7 is:

- decision taken
- date
- decision authority
- artifact or evidence used
- conditions or follow-up actions
- owner for each follow-up action

The decision record may be a standalone artifact or a clearly identified section in another approved record.

## 7. AI-Assisted Delivery Rules

AI may be used to speed up drafting, summarization, traceability checks, review preparation, and revision cycles.

AI must not:

- authorize work
- approve scope changes
- assign or change accountable owners without instruction
- mark deliverables accepted
- invent evidence that does not exist

AI-generated outputs should include clear source context, stable IDs where used, and a concise change summary when materially revised.

Use the [AI-Assisted Authoring Standard](ai_assisted_authoring_standard.md) for the default prompt order, review loop, and guardrails across governed artifact drafting.

If an AI agent is asked to draft or revise a governed artifact and any of the following are missing, unclear, or contradictory:

- approved scope boundary
- required deliverable identity
- named owner or Acceptance Authority
- decision basis
- evidence basis
- status of authorization

the AI should:

- label the output as a working draft
- state the missing control inputs explicitly
- avoid presenting assumptions as approved facts
- avoid marking status as authorized, accepted, or complete
- route the matter back to the Delivery Owner or named human owner for resolution

Where AI or humans draft governed artifacts with multiple sections or sub-sections, visible section numbering is recommended so content can be referenced unambiguously during review, decision-making, acceptance, and change control.

Use numbering consistently in headings where practical, for example:

- `## 1. Purpose`
- `## 7. Required Content or Minimum Structure`
- `### 7.1. Baseline context`
- `### 12.2. Section prompts`

## 8. Practical TL;DR - How This Framework Works in Practice

If you only read one section, read this one.

This framework is meant to answer five practical questions before work becomes difficult to control:

- should this work proceed at all
- what exactly is being approved
- who is allowed to approve it
- how will progress and changes be controlled
- what proves the work is complete and supportable

In practice, the framework works like this:

- Stage 1 Work Assessment - tests whether the work is worth investing in further
- Stage 2 Work Definition - defines what is being asked for approval, including required deliverables and owners
- Stage 3 Work Authorization - gives formal authority to proceed
- Stage 4 Work Definition Details - turns the approved intent into delivery-ready detail without quietly expanding scope
- Stage 5 Delivery Mobilization - sets up the team rhythm, controls, and trackers needed to execute visibly
- Stage 6 Work Delivery - delivers the approved outputs and gathers evidence as the work progresses
- Stage 7 Acceptance, Transition & Closure - formally accepts the result, transfers operational responsibility, and closes the work

Accountable means accountable for moving the stage forward.

The practical implication is simple: work should not move forward because people are busy or because effort has already started. It should move forward because the previous stage produced a clear decision, named ownership, and usable artifacts that make the next stage governable.

## 9. Stage 1 - Work Assessment

**Purpose:** Determine whether the request is worth further investment before entering Work Definition.

**Primary Decision:** Proceed, Defer, or Reject.

**Primary Owner:** ITS, supported by intake / portfolio governance.

### 9.1. Minimum Outputs

- Work Assessment Report
- decision record
- named sponsor or sponsor candidate

### 9.2. Stage Output Checklist

| Output                  | Required  | Accountable              | Practical note                                                              |

| Early stakeholder input | As needed | ITS                      | Keep notes inside the assessment report unless separate notes are necessary |
| Decision record         | Yes       | ITS / Decision Authority | Record proceed / defer / reject and any conditions                          |

### 9.3. AI Use in This Stage

AI can:

- summarize intake material
- help structure the problem statement
- draft the Work Assessment Report from supplied inputs

Humans must:

- confirm sponsorship
- decide whether the work should proceed
- confirm the recorded decision

### 9.4. Exit Criteria

- problem and opportunity are clearly stated
- sponsorship is confirmed or explicitly unresolved
- strategic alignment and early risks are understood
- the decision is recorded
- if proceeding, the work is ready to enter Stage 2

## 10. Stage 2 - Work Definition

**Purpose:** Define the initiative enough to support a sound Work Authorization decision - no more, no less.

**Primary Decision:** Ready or not ready for Work Authorization.

**Primary Owner:** Delivery Owner, with Outcome Owner accountability for business intent.

### 10.1. What Stage 2 Must Produce

Stage 2 stays at authorization-level detail. It defines what the initiative is expected to deliver, why it matters, who owns it, what acceptance will focus on, and what level of cost and risk the organization is being asked to approve.

Deliverable domains may be used to organize the delivery view, but they do not replace visibility of the actual deliverables expected from the initiative.

The **Initiative Definition Document** is the primary artifact for Stage 2. Supporting artifacts may be attached or referenced only when they are needed to hold additional detail that enables a sound Work Authorization decision.

As much as possible, the Initiative Definition Document should contain enough information to support authorization without forcing readers to assemble the decision case from many separate documents.

Deliverables not needed for authorization may still be listed in Stage 2 at summary level so the likely delivery footprint and effort remain visible, but they should be elaborated only in Stage 4. A high-level Delivery Roadmap should be drafted in Stage 2 to support authorization discussions and planning visibility.

### 10.2. Initiative Definition Document Minimum Content

- problem and current-state summary
- future-state intent and expected value
- outcome statement and measurable success criteria
- in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries
- required deliverables for the initiative, grouped by deliverable domain where useful
- named Acceptance Authority for every required deliverable or clearly defined deliverable grouping
- delivery owner, outcome owner, sponsor, and key stakeholders
- approval-level cost, financial impact, and major risk summary
- support and operational ownership expectations
- approval-level functional scope where solution behavior is in scope

Additional expected deliverables not needed for authorization may be listed at summary level so likely effort is visible without forcing premature elaboration.

### 10.4. AI Use in This Stage

AI can:

- draft the Initiative Definition Document from structured inputs
- suggest scope wording, outcome statements, and artifact structure
- help identify candidate deliverables from the [Standard Deliverables Guide](standard_deliverables_guide.md)
- help list additional expected deliverables that may need elaboration after authorization

AI must not:

- decide what is in or out of scope
- decide which deliverables are required without instruction
- assign Acceptance Authorities without instruction
- approve the authorization package

### 10.5. Exit Criteria

- the initiative is defined clearly enough for a go / no-go decision
- required deliverables are explicitly identified at authorization level
- Acceptance Authorities are named for each required deliverable or deliverable grouping
- additional expected deliverables not needed for authorization may be listed at summary level so likely effort remains visible
- owners, cost, risks, and support implications are visible
- the readiness decision is recorded
- the package is ready for Work Authorization

## 11. Stage 3 - Work Authorization

**Purpose:** Formally authorize delivery by committing people, time, funding, and risk to the defined work.

**Primary Decision:** Approve, Defer, Reject, or Approve with conditions.

**Primary Owner:** Decision Authority.

### 11.1. Minimum Outputs

- approved or rejected Project Charter
- decision record
- funding confirmation or explicit funding condition
- any conditions, limits, or phased authorization notes

### 11.2. Stage Output Checklist

| Output | Required | Accountable | Practical note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Decision record | Yes | Decision Authority | Record the actual decision and any conditions |
| Approved Project Charter | Yes for approved work | Decision Authority with Delivery Owner support | Confirms the formal commitment to proceed |
| Funding confirmation | Yes for approved work | Sponsor / Finance / Decision Authority | Must identify the source or condition of funding |
| Authorization conditions log | When applicable | Delivery Owner | Track what must be satisfied after authorization |

### 11.3. AI Use in This Stage

AI can:

- prepare concise approval briefs
- summarize risks, decisions needed, and open conditions
- draft the decision record after the meeting

AI must not:

- make the authorization decision
- claim funding is approved when it is not

### 11.4. Exit Criteria

- delivery is explicitly approved, deferred, or rejected
- the Project Charter status is clear
- funding and accountability are clear enough to proceed
- any conditions are recorded with owners

### 11.5. Hard Rule

No delivery work may start without explicit Work Authorization.

## 12. Stage 4 - Work Definition Details

**Purpose:** Elaborate the authorized initiative into the delivery-ready detail needed to build, test, transition, and accept what was authorized, without changing approved scope, outcomes, capabilities, or acceptance structure.

**Primary Decision:** Ready to mobilize, rework, or return to Stage 2.

**Primary Owner:** Delivery Owner, working with solution and domain leads.

### 12.1. Minimum Outputs

- elaborated versions of required Stage 2 deliverables where further detail is needed
- elaborated Delivery Roadmap aligned to authorized scope, milestones, and dependencies
- additional definition deliverables needed for controlled delivery
- detailed solution and domain-specific design or elaboration artifacts for in-scope work
- acceptance test approach aligned to Stage 2 acceptance focus
- rollout, migration, and recovery approach as applicable
