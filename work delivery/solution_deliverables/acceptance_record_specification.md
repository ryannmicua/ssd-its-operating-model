# Acceptance Record Specification

## Purpose and Intended Outcome

The Acceptance Record provides the consolidated decision trail showing what solution deliverables were reviewed, what evidence supports acceptance, what conditions remain, and whether the named Acceptance Authority has formally accepted the result.

It exists to keep acceptance explicit and auditable. A useful Acceptance Record gives reviewers a concise and attributable basis for sign-off without forcing them to read every supporting artifact in full.

The intended outcome is that solution acceptance is traceable to approved scope and evidence, with any conditions or exclusions made visible at the point of sign-off.

## When It Is Required

This artifact is required whenever Solution Deliverables are formally accepted.

It is especially important when acceptance involves phased delivery, conditions, deferred items, or multiple evidence sources.

## Intended Readers and Users

- Business Owner / Process Owner
- Acceptance Authorities
- Delivery Owner
- governance, audit, and future reviewers

## Intended Project Context

Use this artifact near acceptance time, after validation evidence exists and before or at formal sign-off. It is most useful where scope traceability and decision attribution matter.

It should align with PMI scope-validation and formal acceptance practice by linking sign-off to approved scope and evidence. It should also support the traceability and review discipline expected in controlled delivery and audit situations.

## How Much Detail to Include

Keep the artifact concise and decision-focused. Include enough detail to show what was reviewed, what evidence supports acceptance, what remains conditional, and who made the decision. Link to detailed evidence instead of copying it.

## Required Content or Minimum Structure

This artifact should normally be a structured record with a table-driven core.

### 1. Record identity

Must include:

- initiative or solution name
- record ID or version
- acceptance scope or domain
- preparation date
- prepared by

This section identifies the acceptance record unambiguously.

### 2. Acceptance basis

Must include:

- reference to approved capabilities, modules, behaviors, or deliverables being accepted
- reference to validation evidence
- reference to any related Deployed Solution or release identifier
- statement of the acceptance boundary, including whether the record covers full scope, a phase, or a controlled subset

This section shows what acceptance is based on.

### 3. Required content for each acceptance row

Each acceptance row must include:

- item reviewed
- what was reviewed
- related approved scope reference, such as Capability IDs, Module IDs, or deliverable name
- evidence reference
- status
- notes

Recommended columns:

| Item | What was reviewed | Approved scope reference | Evidence reference | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Use controlled status values such as:

- `accepted`
- `accepted with conditions`
- `deferred`
- `not accepted`

This row structure is the main control model of the artifact.

### 4. Scope compliance statement

Must include:

- statement on whether delivered behavior remains within approved scope
- statement on whether all in-scope items for this acceptance boundary were reviewed or explicitly deferred
- any approved exclusions, waivers, or phased items
- any open items not yet accepted

This section prevents acceptance decisions from hiding scope variance.

### 5. Decision and authority

Must include:

- named Acceptance Authority
- decision date
- formal decision outcome
- any conditions, follow-up actions, and owners if acceptance is conditional
- explicit statement when any residual unaccepted behavior, defect, or variance is being carried forward under condition rather than silently accepted

This section makes the decision attributable and actionable.

### 6. Template guide

Use short entries:

- `What was reviewed`: capability set, module, behavior area, or deliverable
- `Approved scope reference`: cite the authoritative capability, module, or deliverable identifiers that define the acceptance boundary
- `Evidence reference`: point to the evidence location, not the full evidence itself
- `Status`: use the controlled status values only
- `Notes`: use for conditions, exclusions, or clarifications, not hidden decisions

## What to Keep Out

Keep the following out of this artifact:

- full test scripts
- raw defect logs
- long design explanations
- full operational procedures
- meeting narrative that does not affect the acceptance decision

## Relationships to Other Artifacts

This record should align with the Functional Capabilities, Solution Modules, Use Case Narratives, Deployed Solution artifact, and final closure records where applicable.

## Ownership, Review, and Acceptance Expectations

The record is usually assembled by the Delivery Owner or analyst supporting acceptance, then confirmed by the named Acceptance Authority.

The Business Owner / Process Owner usually provides the formal acceptance decision for Solution Deliverables.

## Maintenance Expectations

Update the record until the decision is final. If acceptance is conditional or phased, keep the condition status current or issue a superseding version when conditions are closed.

## Validation Guide

- Can a reviewer understand what was accepted without reading every supporting artifact in full?
- Is the acceptance basis traceable to approved scope and evidence?
- Does the record make it clear whether all approved items in the acceptance boundary were accepted, deferred, or excluded?
- Are conditions, exclusions, and deferred items explicit?
- Is the decision attributable to a named authority and date?
- Does the record rely on controlled statuses rather than ambiguous wording?

If weak, tighten the evidence references, clarify the scope compliance statement, and make the decision wording explicit.

## Prompt Guide for Drafting the Artifact

### Starter prompt

> Draft an Acceptance Record for the Solution Deliverables domain.
> Summarize what was reviewed, what evidence supports acceptance, whether the delivered solution stayed within approved scope, what conditions remain, and the formal decision of the Acceptance Authority.
> Keep the record concise, table-driven, and attributable.

### Section prompts

> Create the acceptance table using the required row fields and controlled status values in this specification.

> Draft the scope compliance and decision sections so any exclusions, conditions, or deferrals are explicit.

### Validation prompts

> Check whether this Acceptance Record proves the basis for sign-off without duplicating the full evidence pack.

> Check whether any open issue is hidden in notes instead of being stated clearly as a condition, deferral, or non-acceptance item.
