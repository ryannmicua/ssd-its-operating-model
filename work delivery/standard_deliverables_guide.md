# Standard Deliverables Guide

## 1. Purpose

Provide a practical reference list of common deliverables used in initiatives governed by the Work Delivery Framework.

This document helps teams think through what artifacts may be needed across different areas of an initiative (such as solution design, data, operations, security, governance, and user adoption).

## Related Documents

- [Work Delivery Framework](work_delivery_framework.md)
- [Deliverable Specifications Index](deliverable_specifications_index.md)
- [Solution Design Process](solution_design_process.md)

## 2. Deliverable Domains

A deliverable domain is a practical grouping of related deliverables.

Each domain covers one important area of delivery, such as solution design, governance, operations, data, security, or user adoption.

Using domains helps teams answer a simple question early: **"Have we covered all critical areas, not only build work?"**

During Work Definition, the team uses domains to organize the deliverables view. Domains do not replace visibility of the actual deliverables expected for the initiative.

Not every initiative needs every domain.

## 3. How to Use Standard Deliverables

Use this document as a **selection and control guide**, not as a requirement to produce every document listed.

1. Confirm which deliverables are required for the initiative, using deliverable domains as an organizing structure where useful.
2. For each relevant domain, select the standard deliverables that fit the initiative size, risk, and complexity.
3. Assign a clear owner and Acceptance Authority for each selected deliverable.
4. Use the domain Acceptance Focus questions to define what "done" means.
5. Collect acceptance evidence as delivery progresses, then record formal acceptance.

Deliverables not needed for authorization may still be listed at summary level during Work Definition so the likely delivery footprint remains visible, even if they will only be elaborated later.

## 4. Operational Use Model

Use this reference differently at each stage:

- **Stage 2 - Work Definition:** identify the required deliverables for the initiative, use domains to organize them where helpful, identify Acceptance Authorities, and define the minimum authorization-level output needed for a sound decision.
- **Stage 3 - Work Authorization:** confirm that selected deliverables, owners, acceptance approach, and major cost/risk implications are decision-ready.
- **Stage 4 - Work Definition Details:** elaborate the required deliverables and any additional definition deliverables needed to build, test, transition, and accept the work.
- **Stage 5 - Delivery Mobilization:** activate the delivery governance and execution controls needed to run the authorized work in a controlled and visible way.
- **Stage 6 - Work Delivery:** produce the selected deliverables and collect evidence against the agreed acceptance focus.
- **Stage 7 - Acceptance, Transition & Closure:** confirm that each in-scope domain has evidence and explicit acceptance.

For smaller initiatives, use the minimum viable deliverable depth. The framework does not require every listed deliverable; it requires deliberate choices, explicit ownership, and acceptance-ready outputs.

## 5. Minimum Viable Deliverable Depth

Apply the lightest depth that still makes the work understandable, controllable, and supportable.

| Initiative profile | Expected depth |
| --- | --- |
| Low complexity / low risk | Concise artifact, possibly combined into one controlled document or appendix |
| Medium complexity / cross-team impact | Separate artifacts for the core in-scope domains, with explicit owners and acceptance evidence |
| High complexity / high risk / regulated / operationally critical | Full domain-specific artifacts, stronger traceability, and more formal review and evidence |

## 6. AI Drafting Guidance

AI is most useful when the team provides:

- the relevant stage and artifact type
- in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries
- named owner and reviewer
- source notes or reference materials
- the required structure or specification
- any required IDs or traceability references

AI should help accelerate drafting, summarization, and traceability checks. It should not decide whether a domain is in scope, assign Acceptance Authorities, or claim that a deliverable is complete without human confirmation.

Use the [AI-Assisted Authoring Standard](ai_assisted_authoring_standard.md) as the default prompt and review protocol when drafting these deliverables.

Where a selected deliverable is written as a structured document with multiple sections or sub-sections, visible section numbering is recommended so the content is easier to review, reference, approve, and update.

Use numbering consistently in headings where practical, for example:

- `## 1. Purpose and Intended Outcome`
- `## 7. Required Content or Minimum Structure`
- `### 7.1. Record identity`
- `### 12.3. Validation prompts`

## 7. Solution Deliverables

### 7.1. Purpose

Deliver the approved business outcomes through an implemented solution that remains aligned to authorized scope and is supported by clear documentation governing scope, structure, behavior, roles, and acceptance.

### 7.2. Standard Deliverables (as applicable)

- **[Deployed Solution](#7.3.%20Deployed%20Solution)**
- **[Functional Capabilities](#7.4.%20Functional%20Capabilities)**
- **[Solution Modules](#7.5.%20Solution%20Modules)**
- **[Use Case Narratives](#7.6.%20Use%20Case%20Narratives)**
- **[User Roles, Personas & Access Model](#7.7.%20User%20Roles,%20Personas%20&%20Access%20Model)**
- **[Acceptance Record](#7.8.%20Acceptance%20Record)**

### 7.3. Deployed Solution

The implemented system behavior that delivers the approved business capabilities and outcomes.

The deployed solution must remain within the intent and boundaries of the authorized scope.

### 7.4. Functional Capabilities

Defines the approved functional scope of the initiative, including:

- The set of approved business capabilities

This document establishes what the solution must be able to do.

### 7.5. Solution Modules

Organizes the approved capabilities into coherent, testable segments that support controlled delivery and acceptance.

This document clarifies how approved capabilities are grouped for build, testing, deployment, and validation, without redefining scope.

### 7.6. Use Case Narratives

Describe how users achieve outcomes using the solution.

Use cases define:

- Who is acting
- What triggers the action
- What outcome is expected

- What must be true for the behavior to be accepted as correct

This is the behavioral validation artifact.

### 7.7. User Roles, Personas & Access Model

Defines:

- The categories of users interacting with the solution
- Their responsibilities, goals, and behavioral expectations
- Access boundaries and separation-of-duties assumptions
- Any sensitive data interactions that affect governance
- Optional personas that provide practical context for how different users within a role operate in real-world conditions

Personas, where used, add clarity to user behavior, constraints, and adoption considerations without expanding authorized scope. They help ensure use cases, validation, and enablement decisions reflect real user needs.

This artifact ensures user behavior, access expectations, and governance assumptions are explicit, reviewable, and aligned with the approved scope.

### 7.8. Acceptance Record

Provides consolidated evidence that:

- All approved capabilities are implemented
- No unapproved behavior has been introduced
- Documented behaviors have been validated

### 8.3. Initiative Definition Document

Defines the problem, future state, outcomes, scope boundaries, and high-level approach that justify investment and guide all downstream artifacts.

It establishes the baseline intent against which scope, design, and acceptance are validated. No downstream artifact may contradict this document without formal revision.

### 8.4. Project Charter

Formally records sponsorship, authority, priority, and commitment to deliver the defined outcomes.

This document confirms that people, time, and funding are intentionally committed.

### 8.5. Delivery Charter

Specification: [delivery_charter_specification](governance_and_control_deliverables/delivery_charter_specification.md)

Defines how the authorized initiative team is chartered and mobilized for controlled execution.

This should make visible:

- what is expected of the delivery team
- team roles and operating responsibilities
- communication methods and operating rhythm
- change, escalation, and decision paths
- control expectations for execution
- acceptance-readiness management expectations

This artifact may also be used as the practical agenda and record for a delivery team kickoff meeting.

This artifact supports controlled execution after authorization. It does not replace the Project Charter, detailed delivery plans, or active trackers.

This deliverable is primarily used in **Stage 5 - Delivery Mobilization**, though it may be prepared in draft form earlier if helpful.

### 8.6. Delivery Roadmap

Specification: [delivery_roadmap_specification](governance_and_control_deliverables/delivery_roadmap_specification.md)

Shows the planned delivery path from mobilization through acceptance, including high-level phases, major milestones, dependencies, and review checkpoints.

Use this deliverable progressively across stages:

- Stage 2: draft a high-level roadmap for authorization-level visibility
- Stage 4: elaborate the roadmap with releases, dependencies, and control checkpoints
- Stage 5: confirm and baseline the roadmap with the mobilized delivery team

The roadmap should remain aligned to approved scope and should be revised through change control when material changes occur.

### 8.7. Decision Record Log

## 17. How to Use This Document

This document serves as the authoritative catalog of standard deliverables and acceptance expectations across deliverable domains.

It does not make every deliverable mandatory for every initiative. During Work Definition, teams determine which domains are relevant and which standard deliverables are appropriate for the initiative's nature, scale, and risk.

Deliverable domains mainly organize the deliverables view. The team should still make the actual required deliverables visible.

### 17.1. During Work Definition (Stage 2)

- Confirm which deliverables are required for the initiative, using deliverable domains as an organizing structure where useful.
- Identify the Acceptance Authority for every required deliverable or clearly defined deliverable grouping.
- Agree which standard deliverables are expected for each relevant domain, at authorization-level depth.
- Additional expected deliverables not needed for authorization may be listed at summary level so likely effort remains visible.
- Use the Acceptance Focus questions as the basis for defining what “done” will mean later at acceptance.

### 17.2. During Work Authorization (Stage 3)

- Confirm that scope, ownership, funding commitments, and risk implications are decision-ready.
- Confirm Acceptance Authorities remain valid for each required deliverable or deliverable grouping.
- Record the authorization decision and associated commitments.

### 17.3. During Work Definition Details (Stage 4)

- Elaborate the required deliverables identified in Stage 2 and produce any additional definition deliverables needed to build, test, transition, and accept the solution.
- Ensure elaboration remains consistent with the authorized scope and intent.

### 17.4. During Delivery Mobilization (Stage 5)

- Activate the Delivery Charter and related execution controls needed for controlled delivery.
- Confirm the Delivery Roadmap with the mobilized delivery team and key stakeholders.
- Confirm reporting rhythm, escalation path, change path, and acceptance-readiness tracking are in place.

### 17.5. During Work Delivery (Stage 6)

- Produce the required deliverables for each relevant domain and collect acceptance evidence.
- Use the Acceptance Focus questions to drive validation and evidence collection.
