# System Administration Guide Specification

## Purpose and Intended Outcome

The System Administration Guide defines how the solution is deployed, configured, administered, monitored, and supported in day-to-day operation.

It exists to convert technical and implementation knowledge into repeatable operating guidance that another competent administrator can follow without relying on the original implementer. A useful guide supports handover, continuity, supportability, and controlled day-to-day administration.

The intended outcome is that routine administration can be carried out consistently, safely, and independently by a competent administrator who was not part of the original implementation.

## When It Is Required

This artifact is required when a solution will be handed to operations or support and has repeatable deployment, configuration, maintenance, troubleshooting, or monitoring tasks.

## Intended Readers and Users

- system administrators
- support teams
- IT operations staff
- Service Owner and Support Owner

## Intended Project Context

Use this artifact during operational readiness and handover. It is most useful where another team must safely deploy, update, operate, and troubleshoot the solution after delivery.

It should align with ITIL 4 Service Configuration Management, Monitoring and Event Management, and Service Desk practices by making administration, monitoring, and support interactions clear. It should also reflect NIST planning discipline by making operational prerequisites, roles, and evidence expectations explicit.

## How Much Detail to Include

Include execution-level operational detail. Another administrator should be able to perform key tasks reliably. Do not turn it into a full design document or a secret store.

## Required Content or Minimum Structure

### 1. Administrative context

Must include:

- system or service name
- covered environments
- administrative owner or document owner
- short statement of what the solution does in operational terms

This section orients the reader to the system being administered.

### 2. Access, tools, and prerequisites

Must include:

- required administrative roles or privileges
- required tools, consoles, scripts, or interfaces
- prerequisite conditions or dependencies
- secure handling notes for access methods

This section tells a new administrator what is needed before work begins.

### 3. Environment and configuration overview

Must include:

- environments in scope
- important components or services interacted with during administration
- key configurable items
- authoritative locations for configuration records where relevant

This section provides operational orientation without repeating full design detail.

### 4. Deployment, release, and update procedures

Must include where relevant:

- normal deployment or release steps
- update or patching steps
- verification steps after deployment or update
- rollback or recovery trigger points
- references to related change or release controls

This section makes repeatable change possible in practice.

### 5. Routine administration tasks

Must include:

- recurring administration activities
- task frequency where relevant
- expected results or checks
- known cautions or dependencies
- any required operational records, tickets, or evidence that administrators must create or update as part of controlled operation

This section defines the ongoing administration workload.

### 6. Monitoring and troubleshooting

Must include:

- what should be monitored or checked
- what normal status looks like
- what to do when abnormal conditions are found
- common operational issues, likely causes, and first-line corrective actions
- escalation points when local resolution is not appropriate
- vendor or specialist escalation dependencies where local teams cannot fully resolve the issue

This section supports supportability and operational continuity.

### 7. Recovery and records references

Must include:

- when rollback, restore, or recovery should be considered
- operational prerequisites administrators must know
- reference to the authoritative Backup, Restore & Recovery Plan
- important logs, dashboards, and operational records administrators must create or update

This section makes recovery and evidence expectations visible without duplicating the full recovery plan.

## What to Keep Out

Keep the following out of this artifact:

- business-case and authorization content
- detailed architecture rationale
- raw credentials or secrets
- the full recovery strategy
- project backlog or task planning

## Relationships to Other Artifacts

This artifact should align with the Technical Design Document, Operations & Support Model, Access Control guidance, and Backup, Restore & Recovery Plan.

## Ownership, Review, and Acceptance Expectations

The implementation lead, system administrator, or technical delivery owner usually authors the guide with operational input.

It should be reviewed by the support team and Service Owner before handover.

## Maintenance Expectations

This is a living operational document. Update it when administrative steps, tools, access methods, monitoring, or escalation paths change.

## Validation Guide

- Can another administrator operate the system safely from this guide?
- Are deployment, maintenance, monitoring, and troubleshooting steps practical?
- Does the guide make evidence, escalation, and vendor-dependency expectations explicit enough for controlled support?
- Are access, records, and recovery references clear?
- Does the guide avoid becoming a design document or a secret repository?

If weak, add missing operating steps, clarify expected results, and remove design-heavy or insecure content.

## Prompt Guide for Drafting the Artifact

### Starter prompt

> Draft a System Administration Guide for this solution.
> Write for the team that will run the system after handover.
> Include administration context, access prerequisites, operational procedures, monitoring, troubleshooting, recovery references, and evidence expectations.
> Keep it execution-focused and secure.
