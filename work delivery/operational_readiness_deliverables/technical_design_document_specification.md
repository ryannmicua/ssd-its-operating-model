# Technical Design Document Specification

## Purpose and Intended Outcome

The Technical Design Document explains how the solution is structured, what it depends on, and what technical decisions affect deployment, operation, security, resilience, and future change.

It exists to make the technical design understandable to people other than the original implementer. A useful Technical Design Document helps delivery, operations, support, security, and future maintainers understand how the solution is built without turning into a runbook.

The intended outcome is that the solution's technical design can be reviewed, supported, changed, and governed without relying on undocumented knowledge held by the original implementer.

## When It Is Required

This artifact is required for any solution with meaningful technical structure, dependencies, integration points, infrastructure, security controls, or operational impact.

## Intended Readers and Users

- solution and infrastructure engineers
- Delivery Owner
- IT Operations / Service Owner
- support teams
- security reviewers
- future maintainers

## Intended Project Context

Use this artifact before deployment and operational handover. It is most useful where the organization needs a design-level explanation of components, environments, interfaces, constraints, and technical decisions that matter after build.

It should align with NIST planning guidance such as SP 800-18 by making system purpose, environment, roles, and controls understandable, and with ITIL 4 service configuration management intent by keeping component and dependency information reliable and accessible.

## How Much Detail to Include

Include enough detail to explain the design clearly and support future operation and change. Do not turn it into step-by-step administration guidance or a project task plan.

## Required Content or Minimum Structure

### 1. Design scope and context

Must include:

- solution or service name
- design scope
- version or status
- short technical purpose statement

This section tells the reader what part of the solution the document covers.

### 2. Architecture and structure overview

Must include:

- major components or services
- how those components relate to each other
- key environment boundaries

This section gives the technical shape of the solution.

### 3. Environment and hosting design

Must include:

- environments in scope
- hosting model or platform
- significant environment-specific constraints or assumptions

This section helps operations and support understand where the design lives and what it depends on.

### 4. Integration and dependency design

Must include:

- key integrations and interfaces
- external systems or services depended on
- dependency risks or assumptions that matter for operation and change

This section supports traceability and later support.

### 5. Data, configuration, and control considerations

Must include where relevant:

- important data-handling design choices
- important configuration assumptions
- security, resilience, capacity, and performance considerations
- operationally significant failure points, single points of dependency, or support-sensitive design constraints

This section helps reviewers understand what technical choices materially affect risk and supportability.

### 6. Significant design decisions and constraints

Must include:

- decisions that future maintainers or operators need to understand
- technical assumptions or constraints that affect later change
- note of any design decisions that require specific operational capability, vendor dependency, or non-standard support arrangement

This section keeps critical design reasoning from being lost.

## What to Keep Out

Keep the following out of this artifact:

- routine operating procedures
- full support workflows
- detailed test scripts
- sprint plans and task assignments
- business-case detail

## Relationships to Other Artifacts

This artifact should align with the Initiative Definition Document, Functional Capabilities, security and data artifacts, System Administration Guide, Operations & Support Model, and Backup, Restore & Recovery Plan.

## Ownership, Review, and Acceptance Expectations

The solution architect, technical lead, or implementation lead usually authors this artifact.

It should be reviewed by operations, security, infrastructure, and support stakeholders where their domains are materially affected.

## Maintenance Expectations

Update the document when architecture, environments, dependencies, or material technical assumptions change. Keep it current enough to support handover and major future change.

## Validation Guide

- Does it explain how the solution is built and what it depends on?
- Are the key technical assumptions, constraints, and control-relevant choices visible?
- Does it make support-sensitive constraints and dependency risks visible enough for operations and handover review?
- Does it stay at design level rather than drifting into operational procedure?
- Could another technical team understand the solution without relying on the original implementer?

If weak, improve the structure overview, add missing dependencies, and move operational procedure detail to the System Administration Guide.

## Prompt Guide for Drafting the Artifact

### Starter prompt

> Draft a Technical Design Document for this solution.
> Explain the structure, components, environments, integrations, dependencies, design assumptions, and the security, resilience, and performance considerations that operations and future maintainers must understand.
> Keep it design-level and do not turn it into an administration guide.
