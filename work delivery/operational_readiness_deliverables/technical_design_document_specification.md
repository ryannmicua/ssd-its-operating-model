# Technical Design Document Specification

## 1. Purpose and Intended Outcome

The Technical Design Document explains how the solution is structured, what it depends on, and what technical decisions affect deployment, operation, security, resilience, future support, and future change.

It exists to make the technical design understandable to people other than the original implementer. A useful Technical Design Document helps delivery, operations, support, security, and future maintainers understand how the solution is built without turning into a runbook or administration guide.

The intended outcome is that the solution's technical design can be reviewed, supported, changed, and governed without relying on undocumented knowledge held by the original implementer.

## 2. When It Is Required

Use this artifact with judgment based on technical and operational significance:

- **Required** for solutions with meaningful technical structure, integrations, infrastructure, security controls, operational impact, or ongoing support implications.
- **Conditionally required** for smaller changes where the implementation is more contained but the technical complexity, shared dependency, or operational dependence is still material enough that the design should be visible.
- **Not usually required** for trivial, low-risk, isolated changes with no meaningful design decisions, integration, infrastructure, security, or support impact.

The practical rule is simple: if operations, support, security, or future maintainers would need a design-level explanation to understand what was built and why, this artifact should exist.

## 3. Stage Fit and Handoffs

- Stage 4: establish the delivery-ready technical design baseline.
- Stage 6: confirm the implemented technical state and highlight material variances.
- Stage 7: provide technical evidence support for readiness, acceptance, and closure.

## 4. Intended Readers and Users

| Reader | How this artifact is used |
| --- | --- |
| solution engineers and infrastructure engineers | Understand the technical structure, interfaces, environments, and constraints they are expected to build, review, or change |
| Delivery Owner | Confirm the design is detailed enough for Stage 4 control, aligned to scope, and ready for delivery mobilization and downstream readiness work |
| IT Operations / Service Owner | Understand hosting, dependencies, support-sensitive constraints, and design choices that affect live ownership |
| support teams | Understand the design characteristics that affect monitoring, troubleshooting, maintenance, restore, and handover readiness |
| security reviewers | Review security-relevant design choices, dependencies, trust boundaries, and control-sensitive assumptions without treating this artifact as the full security assessment |
| future maintainers | Understand significant design decisions, assumptions, limitations, and dependencies before making change |

## 5. Intended Project Context

Use this artifact during detailed solution design, before deployment, and through operational handover. It is most useful where the organization needs an authoritative design-level explanation of components, environments, interfaces, constraints, and technical decisions that matter after build.

This artifact should define the technical scope and design boundary clearly enough that readers understand what this document covers and what sits in related operational, security, data, and support artifacts.

It should align with NIST planning guidance such as SP 800-18 by making system purpose, environment, roles, and controls understandable, and with ITIL 4 service configuration management intent by keeping component and dependency information reliable and accessible.

## 6. Required Content or Minimum Structure

### 6.1. Design scope and context

Must include:

- solution or service name
- scope covered
- version or status
- short technical purpose statement

This section tells the reader what part of the technical design the document covers.

### 6.2. Document information and control

Must include:

- author or owner
- reviewers and approvers where applicable
- last updated date
- related references where useful

This section provides the minimum document-control and review context.

### 6.3. Architecture and structure overview

Must include:

- major components or services
- how those components relate to each other
- boundaries between environments, domains, or trust zones where relevant
- diagrams or references if used

This section gives the technical shape of the solution.

### 6.4. Environment and hosting design

Must include:

- environments in scope
- hosting or platform model
- infrastructure assumptions
- deployment-relevant constraints

This section helps readers understand where the design lives and what hosting conditions matter.

### 6.5. Integration and dependency design

Must include:

- interfaces, integrations, or service interactions
- external systems or services depended on
- dependency assumptions
- operationally significant dependency risks

This section makes important technical dependencies visible for delivery, support, and future change.

### 6.6. Data and configuration considerations

Must include where relevant:

- important data flows or storage decisions
- configuration assumptions
- configuration-sensitive design choices

This section explains the design choices that affect data handling and configuration control.

### 6.7. Security, resilience, and control considerations

Must include where relevant:

- security-relevant design choices
- resilience or continuity considerations
- failure points or single points of dependency
- control-relevant constraints affecting operations or support

This section makes the design's risk-relevant characteristics visible.

### 6.8. Performance, capacity, and non-functional considerations

Must include where relevant:

- performance assumptions
- scale or capacity expectations
- availability or service expectations

This section records the non-functional design assumptions that matter after build.

### 6.9. Significant design decisions and constraints

Must include:

- decisions future maintainers need to understand
- assumptions or constraints affecting future change
- vendor or platform dependencies
- non-standard support arrangements

This section keeps critical design reasoning from being lost.

### 6.10. Operational considerations and support-sensitive characteristics

Must include where relevant:

- design characteristics that materially affect support, monitoring, maintenance, restore, troubleshooting, or handover
- references to related operational artifacts where detailed procedure sits, especially the [System Administration Guide Specification](system_administration_guide_specification.md)

Keep this at design level, not procedure level. Operational steps, administration detail, and execution guidance should sit in the [System Administration Guide Specification](system_administration_guide_specification.md) and related operational-readiness artifacts.

### 6.11. Open issues, unresolved decisions, or known limitations

Must include where relevant:

- unresolved design items
- accepted technical limitations
- follow-up decisions needed before handover or closure

This section prevents important uncertainty from being hidden.

## 7. What to Keep Out

Include enough detail to support technical review, support preparation, handover, operational understanding, and future change. Another competent technical team should be able to understand the design without having to reconstruct it from source code, tickets, or personal memory.

If it is too vague, it will not support handover, review, or later change. If it is too detailed, it will drift into operational procedure and duplicate other artifacts that should remain separate.

Keep the following out of this artifact:

- a runbook
- routine operating procedures
- an administration guide or detailed administration steps
- full support workflows
- a project plan
- detailed test scripts
- project schedules, sprint plans, and task assignments
- business-case or funding justification
- security assessment detail that belongs in dedicated security artifacts

Point to those artifacts where needed rather than absorbing them into this document.

## 8. Relationships to Other Artifacts

This artifact should align with the Initiative Definition Document or other approved scope references so the technical design remains inside authorized scope and approved outcome intent.

It should also align with:

- [Functional Capabilities Specification](../solution_deliverables/functional_capabilities_specification.md), which defines the approved solution behaviors the design must support
- [Solution Modules Specification](../solution_deliverables/solution_modules_specification.md) and [Solution Module Definition Specification](../solution_deliverables/solution_module_definition_specification.md), which break the approved scope into solution structure and module detail
- [Use Case Narratives Specification](../solution_deliverables/use_case_narratives_specification.md), which explain the behavior that the technical design needs to support
- relevant security and data artifacts, which hold deeper control, risk, privacy, or data-governance detail where needed
- [System Administration Guide Specification](system_administration_guide_specification.md), which carries execution-level administration guidance
- [Operations & Support Model Specification](operations_and_support_model_specification.md), which defines long-term ownership, support boundaries, and escalation
- [Backup, Restore & Recovery Plan Specification](backup_restore_and_recovery_plan_specification.md), which defines the recovery path and validation expectations

The Technical Design Document explains the technical design that those downstream operational artifacts rely on. It should give them a clear design basis without trying to replace them.

## 9. Ownership, Review, and Acceptance Expectations

The solution architect, technical lead, or implementation lead normally authors this artifact.

The Delivery Owner ensures the artifact is produced, aligned to approved scope references, and ready at the right stage control point.

Operations, infrastructure, security, and support stakeholders should review it where their domains are materially affected. That review should begin during design, not only at handover.

For materially impactful solutions, the Technical Design Document should be reviewed and accepted as the delivery-ready technical design baseline before build is treated as fully ready to proceed.

## 10. Maintenance Expectations

Update the document when architecture, environments, dependencies, interfaces, or material technical assumptions change.

During active delivery, keep it current enough to remain the usable design baseline. During implementation and handover, confirm it reflects the implemented technical state and any material variance that operations or support need to understand. After go-live, update it for major post-go-live technical change that materially affects understanding, support, resilience, or future design decisions.

Minor administrative edits or inconsequential wording changes do not require formal maintenance activity.

## 11. Traceability and Ownership Minimum

Minimum traceability expectation:

- technical components and design choices can be traced back to approved scope references
- material dependencies, assumptions, and support implications are visible
- material technical changes and variances are reflected in related operational-readiness artifacts

Minimum ownership expectation:

- Technical lead owns design accuracy.
- Delivery Owner ensures alignment to authorized scope and stage controls.
- Operations and support reviewers validate supportability implications where materially affected.

## 12. Quality and Completeness Expectations

Before treating this artifact as ready, confirm that it is:

- scoped, with clear technical boundaries and coverage
- understandable, with a readable explanation of components, environments, interfaces, and constraints
- support-aware, with operationally significant dependencies and design sensitivities visible
- maintainable, with major decisions, assumptions, and known limitations explicit enough for future change
- aligned to related artifacts and approved scope references
- free from procedural overload, with detailed procedures kept in the right downstream artifacts

## 13. Validation Guide

- Does it explain how the solution is built and what it depends on?
- Does it clearly define the technical scope and boundaries of the design?
- Are the key technical assumptions, constraints, and control-relevant choices visible?
- Are major dependencies, interfaces, support-sensitive constraints, and dependency risks visible enough for operations and handover review?
- Are design decisions and unresolved limitations explicit enough for future maintainers?
- Does it stay at design level rather than drifting into operational procedure?
- Could another technical team understand the solution without relying on the original implementer?

If weak, tighten the scope boundary, strengthen the structure overview and dependency sections, make decisions and limitations more explicit, and move procedural detail to the System Administration Guide or other operational artifacts.
