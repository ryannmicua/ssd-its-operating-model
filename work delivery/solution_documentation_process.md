# Solution Documentation Process

## 1. Purpose

Define the recommended workflow for producing, structuring, evidencing, and preparing Solution Deliverables for acceptance within the Work Delivery Framework.

This process:

- Operates inside authorized stage gates.
- Does not redefine deliverable domains.
- Does not create or change Acceptance Authority.
- Structures how Solution Deliverables are documented from authorization through acceptance.


## 2. Governance Boundary

Scope authority is established in Stage 2.

This process:

- Does not authorize delivery.
- Does not expand or redefine approved Capability IDs.
- Does not override the Deliverables Reference & Acceptance Guide.
- Does not replace stage-gated controls.

Following this process does not replace formal authorization.


## 3. Process Overview

Solution documentation progresses in the following order:

1. **Define Authorized Scope** (Stage 2)
2. **Structure Authorized Scope** (Stage 4)
3. **Implement & Evidence** (Stage 6)
4. **Prepare for Formal Acceptance** (Stage 7)

Reversing or blending these steps introduces governance risk.


## 4. Step 1 — Define Authorized Scope



### Artifact: Functional Capabilities

Purpose:
Define the approved functional scope for Solution Deliverables.

### Must Include

- Outcome statement and measurable success indicators
- Explicit in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries
- Atomic Functional Capability statements
- Stable Capability IDs (FC-###)
- Reference to named Acceptance Authority (as defined in Stage 2)
- Version control metadata

### Must Not Include

- Workflows or sequencing
- Business rules or validations
- Technical design or architecture
- Test scripts or acceptance evidence
- Task plans or implementation detail

### Control Rule

If new capability intent is discovered after authorization, the Functional Capabilities document must be updated and agreed to by the relevant owners before work continues.

Functional Capabilities define the approved functional scope for Solution Deliverables.


## 5. Step 2 — Structure Authorized Scope



### Artifacts

- Solution Modules
- Use Case Narratives

### Purpose

Organize approved Capability IDs into coherent, testable behavioral segments without expanding scope.

### Solution Modules

Solution Modules:

- Group approved Capability IDs into bounded segments
- Reference included Capability IDs explicitly
- Remain fully traceable to Functional Capabilities
- Do not introduce new scope

Each Solution Module includes:

- Solution Module ID (SM-###)
- Name and description
- Included Capability IDs (FC-###)
- Associated User Roles
- Contained Use Case IDs (UC-###)

### Use Case Narratives

Each Use Case must:

1. Reference a Solution Module ID
2. Reference one or more Capability IDs
3. Identify primary actor(s)
4. Describe triggering event
5. Define intended outcome
6. Describe high-level workflow
7. Define business rules and validations
8. Define access expectations
9. Define auditability requirements
10. Define acceptance criteria

### Control Rule

If a Solution Module or Use Case requires capability expansion beyond approved scope, the Functional Capabilities document must be updated and agreed to by the relevant owners before work continues.

No behavior may exist without traceability to approved Capability IDs.


## 6. Step 3 — Implement & Evidence



### Artifact: Delivery & Operations Pack

### Purpose

Implement the approved capabilities and assemble the evidence required for formal acceptance and ongoing operations.

### Must Include (as applicable)

**Build & Design**

- Execution-level design required to implement approved Solution Modules
- Integration definitions
- Data structures and configuration detail

**Test & Evidence**

- Acceptance test plan mapped to Capability IDs
- Test results traceable to Capability and Module IDs
- Defect log (if used)

**Deploy & Recover**

- Deployment documentation
- Migration/cutover approach
- Rollback/recovery approach

**Operate & Support**

- Runbooks/SOPs aligned to Solution Modules
- Monitoring expectations
- Operational ownership confirmation

### Traceability Rule

Capability ID → Solution Module ID → Use Case ID → Test Evidence → Deployment Evidence → Acceptance

Progress is measured by accepted deliverables, not effort or activity.


## 7. Step 4 — Acceptance Readiness



Documentation is acceptance-ready when:

- All in-scope Capability IDs are implemented
- All Solution Modules have validated Use Cases
- Evidence is complete and traceable
- Operational handover artifacts are present
- Acceptance Authority can validate outcomes against Stage 2 definition

Delivered without acceptance is not complete.


## 8. Identification & Traceability Standards

Clear and stable IDs are required to maintain traceability.

### Capability ID

- Format: FC-###
- Stable once assigned
- Never renumbered
- Retired IDs are not reused

### Solution Module ID

- Format: SM-###
- Identifies a stable grouping of Capability IDs

### Use Case ID

- Format: UC-###
- Must reference a Solution Module ID and one or more Capability IDs

### Evidence IDs (recommended)

- TE-### (Test Evidence)
- DE-### (Deployment Evidence)

IDs exist to preserve clear traceability from approved capabilities through implementation and acceptance.





## 9. Governance Health Indicators

### Positive Signals

- Functional Capabilities remain stable after authorization
- Solution Modules organize scope without redefining it
- Evidence is traceable across all IDs
- Acceptance decisions reference documented outcomes
- Operational continuity is preserved beyond original implementers

### Risk Signals

- Capability renumbering or duplication
- Adding new behavior through Solution Modules without updating Functional Capabilities
- Behavior without traceability
- Acceptance without evidence
- Documentation created after implementation rather than guiding it

This process governs how Solution Deliverables are documented and evidenced once they are in scope under the Work Delivery Framework.
