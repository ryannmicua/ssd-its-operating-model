# Adoption Confirmation Record Specification

## 1. Purpose and Intended Outcome

The Adoption Confirmation Record provides formal confirmation that impacted user groups were informed, required enablement activities occurred, key adoption risks were reviewed, and the Business Owner acknowledges user readiness.

It exists to keep readiness evidence visible rather than assumed. A useful record shows which groups were prepared, what evidence supports that conclusion, what risks remain, and who confirmed readiness.

The intended outcome is that user readiness is acknowledged on the basis of visible evidence, with remaining adoption risks and conditions made explicit before release or handover.

## 2. When It Is Required

This artifact is required when the initiative needs formal confirmation that adoption preparation was completed before or shortly after go-live.

## 3. Intended Readers and Users

- Business Owner
- Change or Communications Lead
- Delivery Owner
- governance reviewers

## 4. Intended Project Context

Use this artifact near rollout or go-live, after communications and enablement activities have been delivered. It is most useful where user readiness must be evidenced and attributable, not just informally stated.

It should align with PMI stakeholder-readiness and acceptance discipline by linking user preparation to evidence and ownership. It should also align with ITIL organizational change management by making readiness acknowledgement explicit.

In the Work Delivery Framework lifecycle, this artifact is primarily a Stage 7 acceptance and closure input, supported by evidence collected during Stage 5 and Stage 6.

## 5. How Much Detail to Include

Keep it concise. Include enough detail to show what readiness actions occurred, what evidence exists, what risks remain, and who confirmed readiness.

## 6. Required Content or Minimum Structure

### 6.1. Record identity

Must include:

- initiative or rollout name
- record version and date
- prepared by
- scope of user groups covered
- statement of whether the record covers full rollout readiness, phased readiness, or a limited audience subset

This section identifies what readiness claim the record is making.

### 6.2. Required content for each user-group row

Each row must include:

- user group
- communication completed
- enablement completed
- remaining risk or condition
- evidence reference
- readiness status where a group is deferred, conditionally ready, or not yet covered

Recommended table:

| User group | Communication completed | Enablement completed | Readiness status | Remaining risk or condition | Evidence reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

This row structure makes the basis for readiness visible and reviewable.

### 6.3. Business Owner readiness acknowledgment

Must include:

- formal acknowledgment by the Business Owner or delegated authority
- date of acknowledgment
- any conditions or limitations attached to the acknowledgment

This section is the actual readiness decision.

## 7. What to Keep Out

Keep the following out of this artifact:

- the full training content
- campaign asset libraries
- detailed issue logs unless they materially affect readiness

## 8. Relationships to Other Artifacts

This record should align with:

- [Work Delivery Framework](../work_delivery_framework.md)
- [User Impact Assessment Specification](user_impact_assessment_specification.md)
- [Change & Communication Plan Specification](change_and_communication_plan_specification.md)
- [Training & Enablement Materials Specification](training_and_enablement_materials_specification.md)
- [Adoption Support Model Specification](adoption_support_model_specification.md)
- [Acceptance Record Specification](../solution_deliverables/acceptance_record_specification.md)
- [Formal Acceptance & Closure Record Specification](../governance_and_control_deliverables/formal_acceptance_and_closure_record_specification.md)

## 9. Ownership, Review, and Acceptance Expectations

The Change or Communications Lead or Business Owner representative usually prepares the record.

The Business Owner normally confirms the readiness acknowledgment and acts as the normal Acceptance Authority for adoption readiness unless a formal delegation is recorded.

The Delivery Owner is accountable for ensuring this readiness record is available as part of the Stage 7 acceptance package.

## 10. Maintenance Expectations

Update until readiness is confirmed. If readiness is conditional, keep the conditions visible or issue a superseding version when they are closed.

## 11. Validation Guide

- Does the record show clearly which user groups were prepared and how?
- Are remaining risks or conditions visible?
- Does the record make partial, phased, or conditional readiness explicit rather than implied?
- Is the Business Owner acknowledgment explicit?
- Does the record rely on evidence references rather than unsupported readiness claims?

If weak, strengthen the evidence references and make any conditional readiness clearer.

## 12. Prompt Guide for Drafting the Artifact

### 12.1. Starter prompt

> Draft an Adoption Confirmation Record for this initiative.
> Summarize which user groups were informed, what enablement occurred, what risks or conditions remain, and the Business Owner's readiness acknowledgment.
> Keep it concise and evidence-based.
