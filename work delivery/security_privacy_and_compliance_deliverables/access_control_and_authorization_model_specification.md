# Access Control & Authorization Model Specification

## Purpose and Intended Outcome

The Access Control & Authorization Model defines how access to the solution is granted, restricted, reviewed, and governed.

It exists to make access decisions intentional, reviewable, and aligned with role responsibilities and risk. A useful model supports least privilege, separation of duties, and accountable access lifecycle management.

The intended outcome is that access remains deliberately controlled, appropriately limited, and reviewable across the full user lifecycle, with clear accountability for privileged and sensitive access.

## When It Is Required

This artifact is required when the solution has role-based access, privileged functions, sensitive data, approval authority, or integration with identity systems.

## Intended Readers and Users

- Security / Data Protection Officer
- Business Owner / Process Owner
- identity and access administrators
- Delivery Owner and solution leads
- audit reviewers

## Intended Project Context

Use this artifact before implementation is finalized and before access is provisioned in production. It is most useful where access rights, privileged functions, review controls, and identity assumptions must be explicit and defensible.

It should align with NIST SP 800-53 access-control expectations, NIST SP 800-63 identity guidance where relevant, and CIS Control 6 on access control management.

## How Much Detail to Include

Include enough detail to explain access roles, authorization rules, privileged access treatment, account lifecycle expectations, and review controls. Do not turn it into a directory configuration manual.

## Required Content or Minimum Structure

### 1. Access model context

Must include:

- solution or service name
- scope of the access model
- date or version
- owner

This section identifies what environment and functionality the model covers.

### 2. Role and authorization structure

Must include:

- roles or authorization groupings
- what each role is allowed to do
- what each role must not do where restriction is material

This section defines the core authorization model.

### 3. Privileged and sensitive access treatment

Must include:

- privileged access cases
- stronger controls for elevated access where needed
- separation-of-duties assumptions where relevant
- emergency, temporary, or break-glass access handling where such access is possible

This section helps protect high-risk actions from casual or ambiguous handling.

### 4. Access lifecycle controls

Must include:

- provisioning expectations
- change or approval expectations
- periodic review expectations
- de-provisioning expectations
- treatment of non-human, shared, or service access where those access paths exist

This section makes access governance operational rather than theoretical.

### 5. Template guide

Recommended summary columns:

| Role or access group | Allowed actions | Restricted actions | Approval basis | Review expectation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Use references for platform-specific implementation detail rather than embedding it here.

## What to Keep Out

Keep the following out of this artifact:

- raw user account lists unless the artifact is explicitly a controlled access register
- secrets or credential values
- implementation-specific group syntax that belongs in technical administration records

## Relationships to Other Artifacts

This artifact should align with the User Roles, Personas & Access Model, Use Case Narratives, Security & Privacy Risk Assessment, Audit & Monitoring Design Summary, and System Administration Guide.

## Ownership, Review, and Acceptance Expectations

The security lead, identity lead, or solution lead usually prepares this artifact with business owner input.

It should be reviewed by the Security / Data Protection Officer and relevant role owners.

## Maintenance Expectations

Update when roles, privileges, approval logic, identity integration, or review requirements change materially.

## Validation Guide

- Is it clear who can do what and under what approval basis?
- Are privileged and sensitive actions handled more strictly where needed?
- Are emergency, temporary, and non-human access paths governed clearly enough for audit and control review?
- Are provisioning and removal expectations visible?
- Does the artifact support review and audit rather than just initial setup?

If weak, clarify the permission model and make lifecycle controls more explicit.

## Prompt Guide for Drafting the Artifact

### Starter prompt

> Draft an Access Control & Authorization Model for this solution.
> Define roles, permissions, restricted actions, privileged access rules, separation-of-duties assumptions, and how access is approved, reviewed, and revoked.
> Keep it governance-focused and implementation-light.
