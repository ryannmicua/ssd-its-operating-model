# Audit & Monitoring Design Summary Specification

## 1. Purpose and Intended Outcome

The Audit & Monitoring Design Summary describes how key actions, states, and exceptions within the solution are logged, monitored, reviewed, and escalated.

It exists to support accountability, forensic reconstruction, and operational response without becoming a full SIEM implementation guide. A useful summary tells reviewers what events matter, how they become visible, who acts on them, and what limitations remain.

The intended outcome is that material events and exceptions are visible early enough to support accountability, investigation, response, and ongoing operational oversight.

## 2. When It Is Required

This artifact is required when the solution handles sensitive data, privileged actions, important approvals, material operational events, or compliance-relevant transactions.

## 3. Intended Readers and Users

- security reviewers
- IT Operations / Service Owner
- support and monitoring teams
- audit reviewers
- Delivery Owner

## 4. Intended Project Context

Use this artifact before go-live and during control review. It is most useful where important events must be traceable and where monitoring or alerting needs to support detection, review, and response.

It should align with NIST SP 800-53 audit and accountability expectations, NIST CSF Detect and Respond outcomes, CIS Control 8 on audit log management, and ITIL 4 Monitoring and Event Management practice.

In the Work Delivery Framework lifecycle, this artifact is usually elaborated in Stage 4, operationalized in Stage 5 and Stage 6, and referenced in Stage 7 to confirm traceability and supportability controls are in place.

## 5. How Much Detail to Include

Include enough detail to explain which events matter, what must be logged, how alerts or reviews happen, who responds, and how traceability is maintained. Do not turn it into a full tool configuration manual.

## 6. Required Content or Minimum Structure

### 6.1. Scope and purpose

Must include:

- solution or service name
- scope of monitoring and audit coverage
- date or version
- owner

This section identifies what the summary covers.

### 6.2. Events and actions that must be visible

Must include:

- key actions, events, or conditions that must be logged or monitored
- why those items matter

This section defines the high-value visibility requirements.

### 6.3. Review, alerting, and response expectations

Must include:

- what should trigger alerting or review
- who reviews or responds
- escalation expectations where relevant
- any coverage limitations, response dependencies, or known blind spots that materially affect detection confidence

This section connects visibility to operational action.

### 6.4. Evidence and retention notes

Must include where relevant:

- authoritative log sources or systems
- traceability expectations
- retention or evidence considerations that materially affect auditability
- ownership or custody expectations for retained evidence where that affects investigation or compliance handling

This section shows how the information remains usable for later investigation or review.

### 6.5. Template guide

Recommended summary columns:

| Event or action | Why it matters | Logged or monitored where | Review or alert expectation | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Use short, high-value entries. Do not list every low-level technical event.

## 7. What to Keep Out

Keep the following out of this artifact:

- every low-value technical event
- full SIEM rule bodies unless they are the approved design artifact
- vague statements such as "logging enabled" without defining what matters

## 8. Relationships to Other Artifacts

This artifact should align with:

- [Work Delivery Framework](../work_delivery_framework.md)
- [Access Control & Authorization Model Specification](access_control_and_authorization_model_specification.md)
- [Security & Privacy Risk Assessment Specification](security_and_privacy_risk_assessment_specification.md)
- [Technical Design Document Specification](../operational_readiness_deliverables/technical_design_document_specification.md)
- [Operations & Support Model Specification](../operational_readiness_deliverables/operations_and_support_model_specification.md)
- [Compliance & Regulatory Alignment Statement Specification](compliance_and_regulatory_alignment_statement_specification.md)
- [Operational Readiness Confirmation Record Specification](../operational_readiness_deliverables/operational_readiness_confirmation_record_specification.md)

## 9. Ownership, Review, and Acceptance Expectations

The security lead, monitoring lead, or solution lead usually authors the summary.

Review should include operations and any team that will receive or respond to alerts.

The Delivery Owner is accountable for ensuring monitoring and alert-response responsibilities are explicit before go-live. The relevant Acceptance Authority should confirm that monitoring coverage and ownership are sufficient for operational support and auditability.

## 10. Maintenance Expectations

Update when monitored events, alert logic, retention needs, or response ownership change.

## 11. Validation Guide

- Are the important actions and events clearly identified?
- Can a reviewer tell how sensitive or high-risk activity becomes visible?
- Are escalation and review responsibilities clear?
- Are any material limitations or blind spots explicit rather than implied?
- Does the summary stay focused on high-value audit and monitoring expectations?

If weak, focus the summary on high-value events and clarify who acts on them.

## 12. Prompt Guide for Drafting the Artifact

### 12.1. Starter prompt

> Draft an Audit & Monitoring Design Summary for this solution.
> Identify the actions and events that must be logged or monitored, the expected review or alerting behavior, who responds, and any traceability or retention requirements that materially affect control review.
> Keep it summary-level and high-value.
