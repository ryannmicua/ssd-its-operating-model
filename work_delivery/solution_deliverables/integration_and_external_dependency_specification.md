# Integration & External Dependency Specification

## 1. What This Artifact Is For

The **Integration & External Dependency Specification** documents the interfaces and dependencies that the solution relies on to deliver its capabilities. It provides a clear, operational view of each integration, the contract it must meet, and how failure modes are handled.

It answers questions like:

* **What external systems or services does this solution depend on?**
* **What is exchanged (data, events, calls) and how often?**
* **Who owns each dependency and how are failures detected and managed?**
* **What fallback or degradation paths exist if the dependency is unavailable?**

By making integrations explicit, the specification reduces the risk of hidden dependencies, unmanaged failure modes, or unclear operational ownership. It complements the Technical Design Document by focusing on operational and contractual aspects rather than low-level architecture.

## 2. When to Use It

Use this specification when the solution relies on **more than one external integration or material dependency**, including:

* Calls to third-party APIs or services
* Batch or streaming data feeds
* Messaging or event subscriptions
* Shared databases or storage managed outside the initiative's control
* Legacy systems owned by other teams or vendors

It is most valuable when:

* Integration contracts affect system correctness or compliance.
* Dependencies carry their own SLAs, performance or availability constraints.
* Failure handling, retries or fallback behaviour could materially affect user outcomes.
* Operational ownership must span multiple teams or vendors.

Draft the specification in **Work Definition Details (Stage 4)** alongside the Technical Design Document, then refine it in Delivery Mobilization (Stage 5) and Work Delivery (Stage 6) as details are clarified and tested.

## 3. Stage Fit and Handoffs

* **Work Definition Details (Stage 4):** Identify all significant integrations and dependencies. Document their purpose, contract summary, data exchanged, timing, error handling and operational responsibilities. Assign `INT-###` identifiers.
* **Delivery Mobilization (Stage 5):** Refine the specification with input from dependency owners, security and compliance teams, and operations. Confirm SLAs, fallback strategies and monitoring needs.
* **Work Delivery (Stage 6):** Validate integrations in testing. Update the specification with operational considerations discovered during delivery. Link integration tests and evidence in the Validation & Evidence Matrix.
* **Acceptance, Transition & Closure (Stage 7):** Use the specification to support operational handover and acceptance. Ensure service owners and support teams understand the dependencies and their responsibilities.

## 4. Before You Start

Make sure you have:

* A list of all external systems, services or dependencies identified during design.
* Preliminary interface documentation, SLAs or contracts for these dependencies.
* Named owners or contacts for each dependency (internal or external).
* Knowledge of security, compliance, or data privacy constraints associated with the integration.
* Named owner and reviewer for the specification.

## 5. How to Draft It

1. **Create an integration list.** Identify each dependency by name and assign a unique `INT-###` identifier. Include systems, services, feeds or interfaces external to the solution team's control.
2. **Describe the purpose.** State why the dependency is needed and what capability it supports.
3. **Summarize the contract.** For each dependency, capture:
   * Data exchanged (requests, responses, messages, files)
   * Protocols or interfaces used (REST, SOAP, GraphQL, FTP, message bus, database link, etc.)
   * Frequency or timing (synchronous, asynchronous, batch, scheduled)
   * Authentication and authorization requirements
4. **Document operational behaviour.** Describe:
   * Expected response times or throughput
   * Failure modes (timeouts, error responses, partial failures)
   * Retry and fallback strategies (number of retries, exponential backoff, circuit breaker, manual failover)
   * Degradation or graceful shutdown behaviour
5. **Identify ownership and SLAs.** Record who owns the dependency, any service-level agreements, support contacts and escalation paths.
6. **Define monitoring and alerts.** Note how the integration will be monitored (health checks, error rate thresholds, dashboards) and who is responsible for responding to alerts.
7. **Capture security and compliance considerations.** Document any data sensitivity classifications, encryption requirements, audit logging needs or regulatory obligations.
8. **Note testing and validation.** Describe how the integration will be tested (mock environments, contract testing, end-to-end tests) and what evidence will be captured.
9. **Record assumptions and dependencies.** Note assumptions about dependency availability, planned decommissioning, or future changes that could affect integration.

## 6. Minimum Structure

### 6.1. Document header

Include initiative name, version, status, owner, reviewer and date. Summarize the purpose of the specification.

### 6.2. Integration and dependency summary table

Provide an overview of each integration using `INT-###` identifiers:

| INT-### | Name / System | Purpose | Data exchanged | Protocol / interface | Frequency / timing | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INT-001 | Payment API | Validate and process payments | JSON over HTTPS | REST | Synchronous | Vendor X | Requires API key; SLA 99.9% |
| INT-002 | HR system feed | Import employee data nightly | CSV via SFTP | SFTP | Nightly batch | HR IT team | Subject to HR data privacy policy |

### 6.3. Detailed integration entries

For each item in the summary table, provide:

* **Description & purpose**
* **Data exchanged**
* **Interface details** (protocol, endpoints, authentication)
* **Timing & frequency**
* **Operational behaviour** (normal operation, error handling, retry, fallback)
* **Ownership & SLAs**
* **Monitoring & alerting**
* **Security & compliance**
* **Testing & validation**
* **Assumptions & dependencies**

### 6.4. Overall considerations

Summarize any cross-integration concerns such as combined failure impacts, sequencing constraints, shared SLA requirements, or aggregated data sensitivity issues.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

* All significant external integrations and dependencies are identified with `INT-###` IDs and documented.
* Each integration entry describes the data exchanged, interface details, timing, operational behaviour, error handling, fallback, ownership, monitoring and security considerations.
* SLAs, support contacts, and escalation paths are visible for each dependency.
* Testing and validation plans are stated or linked.
* The specification is reviewed and agreed by the Delivery Owner, Solution Lead, IT Operations and any external dependency owners.

## 8. Recommended Acceptance Evidence

* Approved Integration & External Dependency Specification signed by the Delivery Owner and relevant dependency owners.
* Linked test results or contract test evidence confirming interface compatibility.
* Monitoring configuration evidence in DevOps or operations tools.

## 9. Recommended Acceptance Authority

* IT Operations / Service Owner for operational feasibility.
* Solution Lead for correctness and completeness.
* External dependency owners for accuracy of described contracts.

## 10. Prompt Guide

List each significant integration or external dependency with a unique INT-### identifier, describe its purpose, data exchanged, interface details, timing, operational behaviour, failure handling, ownership, monitoring, and security considerations.
Use a table for the summary and detailed entries for each integration.
```

Validation prompt:

```text
Check whether the Integration & External Dependency Specification identifies all material dependencies with INT-### IDs, documents their operational contracts, and addresses failure handling, fallback, ownership, monitoring and security considerations.
```
