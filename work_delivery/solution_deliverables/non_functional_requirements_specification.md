# Non-Functional Requirements Specification

## 1. What This Artifact Is For

The **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Specification** defines the cross-cutting qualities that the solution must exhibit in order to be considered acceptable in production. While Functional Capabilities describe what the solution must do, NFRs describe **how well** it must do it.

This artifact answers questions such as:

* **How fast must the solution respond or process?**
* **How reliable and available must it be?**
* **How will it scale with demand?**
* **What usability, accessibility or regulatory standards apply?**
* **What security, privacy and auditability qualities are required?**

Documenting these expectations early helps teams make design decisions, plan testing, and agree on acceptance criteria that reflect real-world demands instead of implicit or conflicting assumptions.

## 2. When to Use It

Use this specification during **Work Definition Details (Stage 4)** whenever the solution's success depends on qualities beyond basic correctness. It is especially useful when:

* Performance, throughput, latency or responsiveness matter for user satisfaction or operational viability.
* Reliability, availability, failover or disaster recovery capabilities will influence design or cost.
* Usability, accessibility, or ergonomic factors affect adoption and compliance.
* Compliance with specific industry, regulatory or corporate standards is required.
* The solution must scale beyond current volumes, users or locations.
* Changes to non-functional qualities could introduce business risk or require explicit funding.

For very small, non-critical initiatives, these qualities may be captured within other artifacts (for example in use cases or module definitions). For anything with multiple users, integrations, or service-level commitments, a dedicated specification clarifies expectations.

## 3. Stage Fit and Handoffs

* **Work Definition Details (Stage 4):** Draft the quality attributes based on the Problem & Outcome Validation Brief, Functional Capabilities, and known operational expectations. Review them with the Outcome Owner, Delivery Owner, Solution Lead and operational stakeholders.
* **Delivery Mobilization (Stage 5):** Refine and baseline the attributes as part of mobilization planning, linking them to test planning and budgeting.
* **Work Delivery (Stage 6):** Use the attributes to guide performance, reliability, usability and compliance testing. Record evidence and deviations in the Validation & Evidence Matrix.
* **Acceptance, Transition & Closure (Stage 7):** Refer to the attributes when determining whether delivered behaviour meets the agreed acceptance quality.

## 4. Before You Start

Make sure you have:

* A clear understanding of the problem and intended outcomes (see the Problem & Outcome Validation Brief).
* The approved Functional Capabilities and high-level scope.
* Awareness of any corporate or regulatory standards that apply.
* Preliminary operational input on expected service-level targets or supportability constraints.
* Named owner and reviewer with authority to set or negotiate quality targets.

## 5. How to Draft It

1. **Identify applicable quality attributes.** Common categories include performance, reliability, scalability, usability, accessibility, maintainability, portability, security, privacy, auditability, interoperability and regulatory compliance. Select only those that are material to the initiative.
2. **Define target levels.** For each attribute, state the target or range (for example, response time < 2 seconds for 95% of interactions, availability 99.9%, time to restore < 4 hours, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, etc.). Include the rationale for each target and highlight trade-offs if targets may conflict.
3. **Assign stable identifiers.** Give each requirement a unique `QA-###` ID to aid traceability and cross-referencing in the Decision Record Log and Validation & Evidence Matrix.
4. **Specify measurement and monitoring.** Describe how each attribute will be measured (e.g. synthetic testing, load tests, accessibility audits, security scanning), what metrics or KPIs will be collected, and what monitoring and alerting will be required in operations.
5. **Link to modules and use cases.** Where different modules or use cases have different quality expectations, state those differences or note which parts of the solution are most affected by each attribute.
6. **Note constraints and assumptions.** Record any constraints, dependencies or assumptions that affect the ability to meet the target (for example, third-party SLAs, network latency, deployment environments).
7. **Review and agree.** Validate the targets with stakeholders, ensuring they are realistic, measurable and aligned with budget and delivery expectations.

## 6. Minimum Structure

### 6.1. Document header

Include initiative name, version, status, owner, reviewer and date. Summarize the purpose of the specification.

### 6.2. Attribute summary table

Provide a concise table listing each quality attribute and its target. Use `QA-###` IDs for traceability:

| QA-### | Attribute / Category | Target / Threshold | Applies to (FC/SM/UC) | Measurement & Monitoring | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QA-001 | Performance – response time | 95% of user requests < 2 s | FC-002, SM-003 | Load test results; real-time monitoring | Applies to request submission and search flows |
| QA-002 | Availability | 99.9% uptime per calendar month | All modules | Availability monitoring dashboard | Excluding planned maintenance |
| QA-003 | Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | All user-facing screens | Accessibility audit report | Required for compliance |

### 6.3. Attribute details

Provide additional detail for each attribute where needed, including rationale, specific scenarios, scope of applicability, dependencies and trade-offs.

### 6.4. Measurement and monitoring expectations

Describe the tools, metrics, dashboards or processes required to measure and monitor each attribute in production. Note any responsibilities or ownership for monitoring and responding to quality breaches.

### 6.5. Assumptions and constraints

List any assumptions, dependencies or constraints affecting the ability to meet the targets, such as infrastructure limitations, third-party SLAs, or phased roll-out scenarios.

## 7. Writing Rules

Keep each quality attribute:

- measurable, not descriptive — write `< 200 ms response time at the 95th percentile`, not `fast`
- assigned to a category (performance, availability, scalability, security, accessibility, etc.) — do not leave attributes uncategorized
- linked to at least one upstream FC or SM identifier so scope traceability is maintained
- paired with a stated measurement method — the target and the measurement belong together

Keep the following out of this specification:

- test scripts or detailed test procedures (they belong in test plans)
- infrastructure or architecture design detail (that belongs in the Technical Design Document)
- NFRs that simply restate the organizational default without adding initiative-specific context — call out only where this initiative diverges from or depends on those defaults

Where this initiative's quality requirements differ from organizational standards or defaults, call that out explicitly rather than leaving it implicit.

## 8. Traceability and Ownership Minimum

Each quality attribute entry should link upstream to at least one FC or SM identifier and downstream to test evidence in the Validation & Evidence Matrix.

Minimum ownership expectations:

- Delivery Owner confirms quality targets align with approved scope and are achievable within budget.
- Outcome Owner or delegate confirms business-facing targets reflect real operational needs.
- IT Operations / Service Owner confirms operational quality expectations are viable and supportable.

## 9. Done When

This artifact is ready when:

- each quality attribute has a stable `QA-###` ID, a measurable target, and a stated measurement method
- NFRs are categorized and linked to relevant FC or SM identifiers
- attributes that differ from organizational defaults are explicitly called out
- no test scripts or technical design detail have been embedded
- constraints and assumptions affecting quality are documented
- reviewed and agreed by the Delivery Owner, Outcome Owner, and IT Operations

## 10. What Comes Next

After this specification is baselined:

1. use NFR targets to drive design decisions in the [Technical Design Document Specification](../operational_readiness_deliverables/technical_design_document_specification.md)
2. use NFR monitoring and alerting requirements to inform the [DevOps Guide Specification](../operational_readiness_deliverables/devops_guide_specification.md)
3. link each `QA-###` entry to test plans and delivery evidence in the [Validation & Evidence Matrix Specification](../governance_and_control_deliverables/validation_and_evidence_matrix_specification.md)
4. reference NFR targets when confirming quality acceptance in the [Acceptance Record Specification](acceptance_record_specification.md)
